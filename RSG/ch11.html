<h1>Chapter 11</h1>
<h1>Holidays, Customs, and Traditions</h1>
<h2>Russian Holidays</h2>
<p>One of the most efficient ways to know about a country is to learn its traditions and details of its holiday celebrations. All Russian holidays were formed, developed, and corrected by historical events that took place during the last century (like in any other country). Russia’s most popular holiday is New Year’s, not Christmas as in most other Christian countries. The second most celebrated day is Victory Day in May.</p>
<p>Russian people like to celebrate, and there are a lot of occasions because almost every day in the Russian calendar is a professional holiday for somebody. For example, we have a big holiday, Paratrooper Day, which we celebrate in the beginning of August. During this day, you will see all paratroopers on the street with the flags of their forces. They are dressed in telnyashka and beret. Their favorite activity during this day is swimming in the fountains. It is the only day when you can swim in city fountains and not be arrested. Also we have days of Railroad Workers, Day of Teachers, Medical Day, Miner’s, etc. Name a profession and we have a national day devoted for them. These days are usually not bank holidays, meaning we have a reason to celebrate but we still must all go to work!</p>
<p>Also very remarkable days in Russia are Last Bell Day and Prom. These days are really important in the life of every Russian. Last Bell Day is the last day in school of high school graduates. During this day, you will see hundreds of sixteen- to seventeen-year-old girls and boys dressed in the uniform of first-grade pupils. Prom is also usually celebrated on the twentieth of June, and it is a really huge party in all main squares. A big concert is given in Moscow on the Red Square, and the unforgettable event—scarlet sails—takes place on the banks of the Neva River. These unique events include fireworks, a laser show, very huge concerts, and a big celebration.</p>
<p>Following globalization, more and more holidays/celebrations are becoming popular that are imported to Russia from Europe or United States. For example, among young people, Saint Valentine’s Day and Halloween have become popular. Usually, a lot parties are organized during these days. Also you can see a lot of partying in basically all restaurants for any holiday—Catholic Christmas, Saint Patrick’s Day, Oktoberfest, Chinese New Year, etc.</p>
<p>Of course, we have our own traditions for the celebration of our holidays.</p>
<p>New Year’s. Due to the fact that during the Soviet Union the Orthodox church and all religious celebrations and traditions (like Christmas or Easter) were forbidden, people still wanted to have a celebration during the long cold winter. All functions and elements of Christmas were implemented to New Year—gift giving, decorating the tree, Grandfather Frost. During the USSR, and still now, the main Russian holiday is New Year’s. We celebrate it on the thirty-first of December by decorating the New Year tree (fir tree), putting presents under the tree, pretending that Grandfather Frost (Russian version of Santa Claus) gives these presents. Traditionally on New Year’s Eve, the whole family must be together at one table with all types of dishes (dressed herring, Olivier salad, holodets). At midnight, we listen to the speech of the president, listen to the chimes of the Kremlin tower, drink Russian sparkling wine, and make a wish. Unlike in the US the party goes on long after midnight even well into the next few days.</p>
<p>Christmas. After the Soviet Union collapsed, we started to celebrate Christmas. We celebrate it on the seventh of January (celebrated two weeks later than in Catholic countries). For Russian people, it is a new holiday—that’s why we don’t really have strong traditions yet. Of course a lot of Orthodox believers go to church for Christmas mass, but for the general population, its use is as a day off. Some people follow a Christmas fast, and Christmas is their food holiday.</p>
<p>Actually, you need to know that Russia has very long New Year’s and Christmas holidays that starts on the first of January (sometimes thirty-first of December) and finishes on the tenth or eleventh of January. During this period, all offices, organizations, and administrations are closed. I would say that the whole country doesn’t work during this period. Be prepared that if you need a decision made or something confirmed during this period, it will be very difficult to do so. Also this period is the most active period for Russian people to travel—a lot of people use this time to visit other countries.</p>
<p>Orthodox New Year. The next holiday that comes after Christmas is Old New Year (Orthodox New Year). It corresponds to January 1 in the Julian calendar, which was used in Russia before 1918. Usually, it is a working day—not a day off, and for Russians, it officially means the end of winter holidays. According to Russian traditions, all New Year’s decorations must be removed on the next morning.</p>
<p>Defenders of the Motherland Day. We celebrate it on the twenty-third of February, and during the USSR, it was Soviet Army Day. Now it is the day of all men in Russia. Of course, the main goal is to congratulate military people, but now ladies give presents to all men (even to men who have never served in the military). Beginning last year, it has also become an official day off in Russia.</p>
<p>International Women’s Day. The eighth of March, for Russian women, is one of the most important holidays. It is a day devoted to all women: mothers, grandmothers, sisters, daughters, wives, and girlfriends. During this day, every man buys flowers and presents them to the women in his life. If you don’t give a present during this day, you will be cursed by women. As it is always a day off, ladies start to celebrate it on the seventh of March at work and then continue the next day. That’s why on the evening of the seventh of March, you will see a lot of fun-drunk women with flowers.</p>
<p>Orthodox Easter. With the rebirth of the Russian Church, Easter has become a very popular holiday in Russia in commemoration of the resurrection of Jesus. It doesn’t have a fixed date. It is held on the first Sunday after the date of the first full moon that occurs on or after March 21. In Russia, we don’t have days off for Easter. The Friday before and the Monday after Easter are working days. The old traditions have come back very strong. Families color chicken eggs for this day, preparing a special cake, and many people go to church. We don’t have the rabbit as a symbol, and we don’t present chocolate during this day.</p>
<p>May Day. The first of May, originally, was the Day of International Solidarity of Workers, then it became just a holiday of Spring and Labor. For us, it is first day of long May holidays. During the soviet time, when basically all people had dachas (summer cottages) and ogorod, it was the day when they went to plant potatoes. Now it is the day when everyone goes out of the city for picnics and barbecues.</p>
<p>Victory Day. The ninth of May is when we celebrate the Victory of the USSR in the Great Patriotic War (1941–1945), the most dramatic war in Russian history. It is a very important day for Russian people. We always celebrate it with a huge military and veteran parade in all cities. The biggest parade takes place at the Red Square. During this day, all the streets are closed for the parade, and you need to consider it when planning your program. The Red Square, Kremlin, Hermitage, and Palace Square are closed for regular people, so try to plan something outside of the city or be prepared for thousands of people who go to the city center to watch the parade.</p>
<p>Russia Day. We celebrate it on the twelfth of June, and it is the newest holiday in Russia. It commemorates the adoption in 1991 of the Declaration of Sovereignty of the Russian Federation. During the last twenty years, it has had different names, people still are not exactly sure what its name is, but everybody is happy to have an additional day off in June.</p>
<p>National Unity Day. The fourth of November. Two years ago, this day became the day of liberation of Moscow from Polish occupation in 1612 as a result of the uprising led by Kuzma Minin and Dmitry Pozharsky. Before that, it was a day for celebrating the great October revolution which was celebrated on the seventh of November. It is officially a day off. Actually, it was a compromising decision for those who wanted to continue to celebrate Revolution Day and those who were against any Communistic remains.</p>
<h2>Russian Customs and Superstitions</h2>
<p>Superstitions play a huge role in the daily life of Russian people. Everybody, from serious businessmen to little children, follows them. Sometimes Russian people behave weird from the foreigners’ point of view. In order not to behave incorrectly when communicating with locals, you need to know some of the most popular superstitions. Please don’t try to analyze and understand them, just remember.</p>
<ul style='font-family:IowanOldStyle-Roman;font-size:17pt;'>

</ul>
<h2>Russian Tradition of Visiting Someone’s Home</h2>
<p>One of the most popular ways of spending free time in Russia is visiting your friends. During the Soviet Union, it was almost only entertainment as there was a limited number of cinemas, restaurants, etc. Russian people have very long and strong traditions of going to gosti (visiting somebody’s home). You must remember that if you are invited to somebody’s home, it means that you are already among the closest of friends, almost relatives, for hosts.</p>
<p>When visiting Russians, be prepared that almost everybody lives in small flats (two-room apartments and a kitchen—and this is considered to be very good conditions, as it can be much smaller).</p>
<p>There are some unspoken rules for going gosti.</p>
<p>Usually, all starters and drinks are on the table family style, and everybody puts salad to his own plate by himself. Russian people don’t have aperitif, so people pour drinks and start dinner immediately after the first toast. Food allergies are not common in Russia, so if you are allergic to something, you may want to inform your host beforehand so that you don’t feel awkward by refusing food.</p>
<p>When you visit somebody’s home, remember to never arrive empty–handed—it is rude and disrespectful. Bring a bottle of wine, flowers, something sweet, etc. You should know that you are expected to take your shoes off and you will be offered slippers.</p>
<p>During dinner, never make jokes about parents. Russians are not politically correct, so you can make jokes about politics, religions, etc., but be prepared that even simple small talk can become a big political, religious, and very deep discussion. Russians don’t like general neutral talk; they go straight to the core of the most actual problem. Sometimes it is very surprising for foreigners when a dialogue about last weekend turns into debates about the reasons for the collapse of the Soviet Union or the course of action in the Russian Orthodox church. Another thing to remember is that not all humor is international. If you tell a joke that is funny to you, it may not be funny to the Russian listener and vice versa. Things also often get lost in translation, so don’t worry if your jokes don’t make everyone laugh.</p>
<p>One of the comments from my clients is that it is very easy to underdress. Russians always dress very well (in restaurants and parties, going to gosti); people always wear their best clothes for any occasion. They will dress in the same clothes going to a museum in the morning and then to a party in the evening.</p>
<p>Some other rules of unofficial communication in Russia are the following:</p>
<ul style='font-family:IowanOldStyle-Roman;font-size:17pt;'>
<li>When you invite a woman for dinner, automatically you are paying for her; she will expect it. People do not go Dutch. As an American woman, this is always difficult for me because I am afraid that the other person expects something if they buy me dinner, coffee, or whatever. This is, however, not the case. Men pay because it is the manly thing to do!</li>
<li>Don’t let a lady carry something heavy. I find this to be a little bothersome. I am a strong woman and can carry as much as most men, but because I am female, I shouldn’t. Men will take my bag, which is often quite heavy and filled with books and opera scores, but I often prefer to carry it myself.</li>
<li>For Russian men, it is natural to let women enter through the door first and to hold the door. It is just politeness. This is something I get confused by with my American upbringing. I never know what to do, so I feel a little awkward. I am lucky if guys in the States don’t let the door slam in my face!</li>
<li>Always offer seats to old people in public transport.</li>
<li>If you are coming for a birthday party, you don’t need to bring anything except a present.</li>
<li>Also don’t be surprised if you are invited for an overnight stay (with the excuse that it is too late to go home). It is not a problem, however, to get a taxi at any time, and one should not feel obligated to stay.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Alcohol Habits in Russia</h2>
<p>There are a lot of jokes and stereotypes about Russian people and alcohol. Unfortunately, vodka became one of the main symbols of Russia for foreigners.</p>
<p>Yes, we have to admit that, unfortunately, Russian people consume a lot of alcohol (according to the report of WHO in 2011, Russians were fourth place in the world), especially in small towns and villages. The government is trying to solve this problem by increasing taxes for alcohol and limiting sales (for example, you can buy alcohol in Russia only from 8:00 a.m. till 11:00 p.m., in some cities till 10:00 p.m.). Also you cannot buy alcohol in Russia if you are under eighteen years old. This policy is giving result—in big cities, the problem of alcoholism is not as bad as it was before.</p>
<p>The vodka subject is very important in Russia from different points of view—from economic, cultural, and historical. Real Russian vodka is distilled by using water and pure grain alcohol. It must be 40 percent grain. Real vodka must be clear in appearance and has no particular flavor (except ethanol). It is very rare when vodka has added flavor. It is very often foreigners call by mistake flavored vodka with cranberry or cherry nastoiki (usually 23 percent alcohol) or pepper and horseradish samogon (can be 80 percent alcohol).</p>
<p>When we speak about vodka, you need to know that we have real drinking rituals that we have been following for centuries.</p>
<p>Russians like to pronounce toasts during the meals, especially when guests are present. It is obligatory to respond by drinking the whole shot of vodka at the same time. Vodka is typically drunk straight without anything else (ice or juice, for example). The shot must be followed by eating something salty such as a pickle or herring.</p>
<p>In Russia, we have a lot of superstitions concerning drinking. For example:</p>
<ul style='font-family:IowanOldStyle-Roman;font-size:17pt;'>
<li>It is bad luck to put a glass with alcohol back on the table after a toast has been said. It must be drunk fully.</li>
<li>It is considered bad luck to make a toast with an empty glass. If done, the toaster must finish off the bottle..</li>
<li>Russians say, “Between first and second shots, interruptions must be short.”</li>
<li>If you’re late for the table, you will need to drink a very full glass. For example a cup of vodka instead of a shot. This is so you can very quickly catch up to the rest of the party.</li>
<li>Before leaving the table, you need to drink a last glass, so-called na pososhok, for good luck</li>
<li>Every portion of drink must be accompanied by a touch of glasses and a toast. Only at a funeral and commemoration are there exceptions; there the touch of glasses is forbidden.</li>
<li>It is not allowed to pour out by hand holding a bottle from below.</li>
<li>It is not allowed to fill a glass being held in the air.</li>
<li>It is considered bad luck to put an empty bottle back on the table when it’s finished.</li>
