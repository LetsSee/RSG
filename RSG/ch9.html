<h1>Chapter 9</h1>
<h1>Restaurants and Nightclubs</h1>
<h2>Restaurants</h2>
<p>The restaurant business in Russia is growing like crazy right now. Some of the best restaurants in the world are located in Moscow. You can find a huge variety of places at the same high level as in New York, London, or Paris. The best chefs are happy to work in Russia.</p>
<p>The most popular restaurants in Russia are extremely popular among locals not because of the quality of food or service but because of the fresh ideas and fashionable concept. For foreigners, this idea of fashionable concept is not new—it is a regular place that you can find in any country—but for Russian people, who didn’t have it during soviet period, all this is very new and exciting.</p>
<p>New restaurants are being opened and closed almost every day in Moscow. Usually, the lifespan of one place is no longer than one year. New places are packed with guests during the first three weeks, then another new place opens, and customers who are looking for something fresh go there. The first place becomes less popular, and in less than a year, it closes and in the same place opens a new restaurant with new a concept. If a restaurant is really good (this means a combination of good food, high-quality service, and interesting concept), it attracts people not only by its new concept, and it lasts more than year.</p>
<p>A lot of rich people in Moscow have opened a restaurant just for fun—to have a place to go with their friends. They open it not for profit but for bragging. That’s why they invite the best designers and the world’s best chefs to make the most impressive place. Sometimes these places are not very good for regular visitors as the staff know that this place is oriented not to mass public and their main target is to serve the owner and his parties.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there are not so many restaurants for the middle class and middle level where you can eat good food with a reasonable price. There are a lot of very expensive restaurants with high cuisine, and on the contrary, really low budget restaurants and low quality food that are not safe. If you are looking for something middle, always do good research.</p>
<p>The biggest restaurateurs in Russia are the Novikov Group and Ginza Project. Restaurants managed by these companies are extremely popular. People go there knowing that the restaurants are managed by these groups, and it is a guarantee of good quality. These restaurateurs became very successful in Russia because they started to offer new concepts and have good chefs. Many people go there not for food (which is really good) but because their restaurants are always fancy and trendy. Novikov Group is the leader in Moscow, and Ginza Project is in Saint Petersburg, but they also have restaurants in New York, London, and Miami.</p>
<p>As I mentioned before, Moscow can offer the best restaurants in the world, whereas the situation in other Russian cities is different and you need to know the specifics. First, you should remember that only twenty years have passed since the Soviet Union, when we didn’t have a culture of restaurants and hospitality in general. Moscow and Saint Petersburg have managed to reach international level of services in most spheres of life—hotels, restaurants, businesses, etc.—but other Russian cities are a little bit slower to develope in comparison. Most of the places in Sochi, Ekaterinburg, and Irkutsk are almost the same as they were in the ’90s. The level of service there is a little bit lower and design can be not so up to date as in Moscow, but it doesn’t mean that they have bad food. Therefore, when visiting a restaurant not in Moscow and Saint Petersburg, please be prepared for it—you should remember that we have the biggest country in the world and changes that we have now are not always as fast as people would like.</p>
<p>It is an interesting fact that karaoke was very popular in all restaurants in Russia in the ’90s. Now it is not very easy to find a karaoke in Moscow and Saint Petersburg (in really nice places in central parts of the city, not in the suburbs), but almost every place in other cities still offer it, and it is very popular among locals. Actually, if you want to feel the atmosphere of the ’90s, you can go to any restaurant in any Russian city and find it there.</p>
<p>Sushi and any Japanese food are extremely popular in Russia. Even if you go to an Italian, French, or Russian restaurant, you will find a menu offering a huge variety of sushi, sashimi, and rolls.</p>
<p>A restaurateur opened a steak house in a very good location—very close to the metro where a lot of people are located. It was not expensive and offered one of the best steaks in Russia. After six months, he closed the restaurant because it was always empty despite the fact that he had the best meat, very nice modern design, good service, and reasonable prices. The only minus of this place was that they didn’t serve sushi. He decided to promote this place as a sushi restaurant, included Japanese food to the menu, put up a big sign advertising SUSHI, and immediately after that, it was always packed with people. He kept absolutely everything the same, just changed the sign to advertise sushi.</p>
<p>The second most popular cuisine in Russia is Italian. You can find different levels of quality—from extremely high to fast-food style. Georgian food is also very popular; the places are not very fancy, but the food is really good. Actually, you can find all types of cuisine in Russia—even Iranian or African.</p>
<p>The new fashion in Russia is to open a restaurant together with a famous person announcing that this restaurant belongs to him or her. Actually, they are just using the name of the person and paying them for the usage. Stars don’t have anything to do with food or design. They just promote the restaurant using their names. It is the same idea as a sports star promoting a pair of athletic shoes.</p>
<h2>Fast Food in Russia</h2>
<p>At this moment, we have all the main international fast-food companies (KFC, Subway, Carl’s Junior), but the most popular is McDonald’s. McDonald’s restaurants in Russia are places for families. People come here with their whole family for lunch during the weekend. They spend there a lot of time; they don’t just eat and go. Russian McDonald’s are some of the cleanest in the world. The biggest McDonald’s in the world is located in Moscow. In 1988, when the first McDonald’s was opened in Moscow, people spent up to four hours in line. The entire Pushkinskaya Square was occupied by people waiting their turn to order burgers. McDonald’s even had a special position—line organizer.</p>
<p>Russia also has its own fast food, Teremok and Chainalay Lozhka (famous for blini) and Kroshka Kroshka (famous for baked potatoes with typical Russian toppings). When visiting these places, you must remember that this is fast food and the quality is not perfect, but here you can taste real Russian blini or potatoes with different toppings. If you understand that it is cheap, simple food, you can even enjoy it. Russia (especially Saint Petersburg, where it started) is proud of Stolle café, a type of fast food selling the tastiest covered pies. It started as a small café and has since become a chain in many Russian cities (also in the Ukraine and Belarus). I strongly recommend visiting it and trying the pies—it is simple, cheap, safe, and really tasty.</p>
<p>Warning: Unfortunately, fast-food restaurants are a favorite place not only for children and the weary traveler, but also thieves. My dear friend (a St. Petersburg native) and her toddler went to a very popular fast-food chain to have some French fries. As my friend placed her purse on the chair to remove her son’s outwear, thieves reached into her purse and took her phone and wallet. She wasn’t more than two feet from her purse but was paying attention to her son. When she realized that her things had been stolen, she asked the dinersaround her if they had seen anything; they had but hadn’t tried to stop the thieves. She then spoke with the security guard of the restaurant, and he told her there was nothing he could do and she must contact the police. After contacting the police, she was informed that in this particular restaurant, it was very common for thieves to work and often paid a cut to the security guard so that they could get away with it. The moral of the story is to be very aware of your surroundings; even in a place that may feel the same as in your home country, you should still take care!</p>
<p>Coffeehouses are a new fashion in Russia. We have Starbucks (only in Moscow and Saint Petersburg) and Austrian Coffeeshops. Russian Coffee House is an extremely fast-growing chain. They appeared in Russia quite recently, as little as eight years ago, and have started to grow very quickly. If you go to the main street (Tverskaya and Nevsky), you will see that every second building has coffeehouses. In other cities, it is not as developed, but it is growing.</p>
<h2>Bar Culture in Russia</h2>
<p>Bar culture in Russia is a separate question. You must be ready for it in advance. We don’t have so many bars or pubs (in classical form—where you are coming just for drink before or after dinner). Usually, all our bars are bars inside of a restaurant. And usually, people don’t go out just for drinks. If they go out, they sit at the table and order food and drinks. This is part of Russian culture—food must be included with drinking. It is not very easy to find a place where people come only to drink.</p>
<p>Of course, in Moscow, you will find a lot of nice bars at a really high international level. In Saint Petersburg there are several nice bars, but usually, it is a restaurant with a bar. In other Russian cities, you will not find bars; it will be a restaurant with a bar, but all the space will be occupied by tables.</p>
<p>Actually, the culture of cocktails and receptions is different than in other countries. Russian people don’t use receptions for mingling and networking. If you organize cocktails for Russians, they will take the drinks, divide into small groups, and spend the whole evening all together. Networking in the Western style happens very seldomly in Russia.</p>
<h2>Tea Culture in Russia</h2>
<p>Tea is very popular in Russia. Russian people always drink it hot. According to a 2005 study, 82 percent of Russians drink hot tea every day.</p>
<p>Due to cold northern climate, hot teas can be considered a national beverage and one of the most popular beverages in the country. It is closely connected to the image of Russian culture—samovar—the symbol of hospitality and comfort Actually, we don’t use samovars at home anymore. Historically, Russians drank tea in the afternoon, but later it became an all-day drink. It was always served at the end of a meal together with dessert. Tea has never been an independent beverage—it was always taken with jam, syrup, cakes, cookies, and other sweets.</p>
<p>Usually, we drink imported tea. But we produce our own tea in the south of Russia, in the Sochi area, but it is not so popular.</p>
<p>Black tea is the most popular, but recently it has become very popular to drink green tea, oolong, etc.</p>
<p>A notable feature of Russian tea culture is the two-step brewing process. Firstly, tea concentrate (zavarka) is prepared: a quantity of dry tea sufficient for several people is brewed in a small teapot. Then, each person pours some quantity of this concentrate into the cup and mixes it with hot water; thus, one can make thetea as strong as one wants, according to taste. Sugar, lemon, honey, or jam can then be added freely.</p>
<h2>Russian Restaurants and Russian Cuisine</h2>
<p>It may sound crazy, but it is not so easy to find a good restaurant of real Russian cuisine in Russia. For example, in Moscow and Saint Petersburg, you can count them on two hands. Of course, we have a lot of Russian places, but quality isn’t always that good. That’s why you must be very careful when choosing Russian restaurants.</p>
<p>Remember that steaks are not a strong suit of Russian restaurants. Traditionally Russians cook their meat until it is very dead. We have only two or three places in the city where you can find a really good steak. We always eat meat well done, never raw. That’s why in steak houses when you order medium rare, you will get well done. That’s why if you want to eat beef it is better toorder beef Stroganoff.</p>
<p>Beef Stroganoff is significant to Russian cuisine and it has a very interesting story. Count Stroganov had a really good chef who cooked for him really wonderful steaks with tasty sauces of mushrooms and cream. When the Count broke his right hand and couldn’t use the fork and knife to cut the steak, his chef cut the steak into pieces, mixed it with sauce, and served it for dinner. The Count liked it so much that he asked his chef to cook it all the time.</p>
<p>It is recommended that you try the following Russian dishes:</p>
<ul style='font-family:IowanOldStyle-Roman;font-size:17pt;'>
<li>Cranberry Morse. Nonalcoholic drink made of mashed-cranberry juice with added sugar and water. Always drink it chilled.</li>
<li>Chicken Kiev Cutlet. Breaded cutlet made of chicken breast pounded and rolled around cold garlic butter with herbs, then breaded and fried (or baked).</li>
<li>Borscht with Sour Cream. Soup made with beetroot as the main ingredient, usually includes cabbage, meat, and potatoes. Can be cold or hot. Recommended to eat with a dollop of sour cream mixed in.</li>
<li>Blini with Caviar or Jam. Russian blini are a type of thin pancakes. They are very similar to French crepes, but blini are typically thicker and include a leavening agent. In Russia, you can eat it as a hot starter (with caviar, salmon, sour cream) or as a dessert with jams, honey, or sweetened-condensed milk.</li>
<li>Beef Stroganoff with Mashed Potatoes. Sautéed pieces of beef with sauce ofsour cream and mushrooms. Strongly recommended to eat with mashed potatoes.</li>
<li>Kvass. It is a nonalcoholic fermented beverage made from black or regular rye bread. Kvass is also used for preparing a cold summertime soup called okroshka.</li>
<li>Okroshka. It is a cold Russian soup, a mix of mostly cucumber, spring onion, boiled potatoes, eggs, and a cooked meat such as beef, veal, sausages, or ham with kvass. It is always served with sour cream.</li>
<li>Dressed Herring (or Herring under Fur Coat) Salad. Layered salad composed of diced salted herring covered with layers of grated boiled vegetables (potatoes, carrots, beetroot), chopped onions, and mayonnaise.</li>
<li>Olivier Salad (also known in Russia as Stolichny). Traditional Russian salad made of diced potatoes, vegetables, boiled eggs, sometimes with ham, and dressed with mayonnaise.</li>
<li>Pelmeni. Dumplings consisting of a filling wrapped in thin, unleavened dough. The dough is made from flour and water, sometimes adding a small portion of eggs. The filling can be minced pork, beef, lamb, or any other meat, also fish and mushrooms.</li>
<li>Pozharskaya Cutlet. Minced chicken meat (cutlet) covered in bread crumbs or croutons and panfried.</li>
<li>Pirozhki. Baked stuffed buns made from yeast dough and often glazed with egg to produce the common golden color. They commonly contain meat or a vegetable filling (mashed potatoes, mushrooms, onions and egg, or cabbage). They could also be stuffed with stewed or fresh fruit (apples, cherries, apricots, chopped lemon, etc.), jam, or cottage cheese.</li>
<li>Russian Pickles. Strongly recommended to try pickled garlic, cheremsha—garlic springs, salted cucumbers, tomatoes, and mushrooms.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Russian Etiquette and Specifics</h2>
<p>When visiting a restaurant in Russia, you need to know that during the Soviet Union, there were very few restaurants in the cities, and people went there only for very special occasions. Soviet restaurants were very famous for their rude waiters and bad food. Now the situation has changed, of course, but still you must remember that we have had only twenty years to develop the restaurant and hospitality industry from nothing.</p>
<ul style='font-family:IowanOldStyle-Roman;font-size:17pt;'>
<li>Historically, when Russian people have a party (birthday celebration, wedding, or anniversary), they always order family style—put the maximum on the table, a lot of cold and hot starters. During a banquet, there must be a lot of food on the table; otherwise, it is considered poor.</li>
<li>In all restaurants, the menus are always very big, but it is very often that not all products are available, and they cannot cook all dishes.</li>
<li>Sometimes there are a lot of waiters, but it doesn’t mean that service will be fast.</li>
<li>Tips and gratuities are not mandatory in Russia. Usually, waiters expect 10 percent; sometimes they add it to your bill automatically without warning (but it happens only in Moscow). If it is not included automatically, you need to pay by cash—they don’t accept tips by credit card, they cannot put it to your bill and charge your card. That’s why when you go to a restaurant, prepare some cash as well.</li>
<li>The wardrobe is usually free of charge; the person at the wardrobe usually doesn’t expect tips.</li>
<li>It is very strange, but you are not allowed to enter a restaurant in your coat, even if it is just for three minutes to see the interior. You have to leave coats in the wardrobe or keep them in your hands.</li>
<li>Smoking is still allowed in restaurants, but after June 1, 2014, it will be forbidden everywhere.</li>
<li>American Express is not always accepted in restaurants; Diners and Discover, never. Always check at the very beginning if the restaurant accepts credit cards.</li>
<li>Russians don’t use ice often —never with coke or beverages. Always ask additionally for ice.</li>
<li>Water is not offered and served automatically like in the US. It is always in bottles; it is never served in pitchers. We never drink tap water—it is dangerous.</li>
<li>When ordering water, always check the brand and price as sometimes restaurants automatically bring the most expensive water. Also be prepared that very expensive restaurants in Moscow don’t serve regular water—they have only Voss or the same level of expensive water.</li>
<li>Usually, the bread basket is served free of charge, but in nice restaurants they have a special selection of bread, and they charge for it. Always check with the restaurant.</li>
<li>Russian people like terraces (patios) during summer. Every restaurant opens them, even if it is located right on a sidewalk of a high-traffic area and people are breathing in car gases and listening to noise from the traffic. Still people prefer to sit outside during summer.</li>
<li>Kalians (hookahs) are extremely popular in Russia; you can find them almost everywhere. All different flavors are available.</li>
<li>There are not so many places with a dress code. You can go to the most expensive place with the best interior and highest cuisine and find people there dressed in tuxedos sitting next to people dressed in jeans or sweat pants.</li>
<li>The new fashion in nice places is to organize children’s rooms.</li>
<li>Russian singers love to give concerts in fancy restaurants.</li>
<li>Dessert is eaten with tea or coffee.</li>
<li>When you see on the menu cutlet, it means that it is made of minced meat.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Wine Culture</h2>
<p>When visiting Russian restaurants, remember that Russia is not a wine-producing country; wine is produced only in the south, Krasnodar region near Sochi. In Saint Petersburg, local wine is served in Restaurant Porvorie, but not so many foreign visitors really like it—and this wine is considered the best Russian wine.</p>
<p>You should remember that all wine is imported and taxes are very high for imports; that’s why wine is expensive not only in restaurants but even in regular shops.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, historically (seventy years of Soviet Union) we don’t have really strong wine culture. In addition not everybody in Russia drinks wine, and as result, we don’t have a lot of wine experts among restaurateurs and customers. As a result, waiters can mix glasses as they don’t know wine culture—i.e., red wine in white wine glass. Also the temperature of the wine is not always correct—red can be colder than necessary, white wine can be not cold enough.</p>
<h2>Nightclubs in Russia</h2>
<p>Nightclub and bar culture is a question that requires separate discussion in order to be prepared for it when you are in Russia.</p>
<p>First, you need to remember that during the Soviet Union, we didn’t have nightclubs at all! The maximum we had were dancing evenings in public parks that ended at 10 p.m.; therefore, nightclub history is very short (only twelve years) in Russia. Of course, this side of Russian life is not as developed as in other countries where nightlife has been turned into a real industry.</p>
<p>One thing that you need to know about planning your trip to a nightclub is that, generally, people don’t go to nightclubs after they have turned twenty-five. In Russia, nightclubs are more for students and youngsters. It is very seldom when you see people older than thirty-five dancing at nightclubs. That’s why when foreigners ask about where they can go dancing, it is not easy to find a place where they feel comfortable, where they are not the oldest among the club’s young visitors.</p>
<p>Moscow is the capital of nightlife in Russia. All the best and most conceptual fashionable clubs are located there. Of course, we have a lot of clubs in Saint Petersburg, but it doesn’t even compare with Moscow. In other cities, the number is very limited. In Moscow, the most trendy and popular clubs are opening as temporary projects for six months and then a new one is opened at the same venue. The best DJs and most famous people are there. All these clubs have very strong face control. There are a lot of the simple and democratic clubs which are available to serve the rest of the public.</p>
<p>Actually, in Moscow and Saint Petersburg, you can find all types of clubs, dancing, striptease, gay clubs, clubs for those who are older than forty, etc. Before you go to any club, be sure to check what their target audience is in order not to be alone among teenagers or not well prepared for face control and underdressed. It is much easier for foreigners to go through face control as they are always welcome in usual nightclubs; they just need to be dressed properly.</p>
<p>When visiting nightclubs you need to know about the system of payment in the main part of them. Usually, in all nightclubs there is a system of deposits. It means that if you want to have a table, you need to order it in advance and pay deposit (about EUR 100 per person, but the amount can vary from club to club) so you will have your table and you will be able to dance, sit in your place, and have drinks and snacks for this sum. If you don’t want to pay deposit, you will be able to dance and be in the bar, but without a table. This is the usual case for very fashionable and popular clubs with very strong face control. In Moscow, usually all nightclubs work like this; in Saint Petersburg and small towns, not many of them do.</p>
<p>Speaking about bars in Russia, we can say that more and more bars are opening in Russia now, but still it is not classic bars. Usually, it is a restaurant with a bar. So when you are looking for a “real” bar—just for drinking—check if this is really what you want; otherwise, you will be seated at a table.</p>
<p>Four years ago, many nightclubs also had casinos, but after 2009, casinos became forbidden on the territory of Russia. There are only four regions in Russia where it is allowed, but these regions are in the process of development at this moment. All former casino venues were turned into nightclubs or event venues.</p>
