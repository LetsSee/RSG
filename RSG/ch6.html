<h1>Chapter 6</h1>
<h1>Money and Shopping</h1>
<p>If you ask people in the world about Russians, they will tell you that Russians are very rich, that they spend so much money, and nobody in the world does shopping the way Russians do.</p>
<p>Yes, it looks like this from outside. But if you look at it more deeply, you will see what is really going on. To understand it, you must know some facts about Russian people and their relationships with money.</p>
<h2>Savings and Financial Planning</h2>
<p>Nobody (we mean the general population of employees and office workers) has savings. People don’t save; they don’t trust banks. There have been too many situations during the last twenty years when all savings in the bank became the value of toilet paper due to government policy, changes in structure, and financial crisis. That’s why people, as soon as they have money,they “invest” it. If you have enough money to buy an apartment, you do it. If you don’t have money for real estate, buy a car. If there is not enough money for a car, go to the bank and take a loan and buy a car or even a telephone or smartphone. If your salary doesn’t allow you to take credit in the bank, go and buy clothes. In short, it isn’t a good plan to have lots of Russian rubles under your mattress because you may wake up one morning with a mattress full of useless paper.</p>
<p>If you look at Russian people, you will see that a lot of them have very expensive telephones and clothes, and it doesn’t mean that these people have a lot of money; usually, it means that people just don’t have enough money for a car! Russians feel that they need to show what money they do have and the simplest way to do that is with clothes or a phone.</p>
<h2>Crazy Shopping</h2>
<p>You see Russian people with bags in airports and on the streets of New York and Milan but that is not because they have a lot of money that they can spend easily—they are doing it to save money! In Russia, the same clothes cost three to four times as much. For Russians , it is cheaper to buy an air ticket to Milan twice a year and go shopping there than to buy the same things in Russia. Plus the quality is not as high as in Europe or US. Usually, in Russia, they bring clothes produced for third-world countries that do not meet the quality standards for US and Europe. Plus in the past, there were no opportunities to travel and have such an assortment of goods, so now Russian people have this chance and they use it to compensate for years of shopping deprivation.</p>
<p>Another interesting fact is that, generally, Russian people don’t trust anything cheap, but still will be happy to get freebies. Also you will never find an equivalent word for bargain in Russian culture.</p>
<h2>Your Look</h2>
<p>In Russia, it is more important to look, than to be—that’s why we have to dress as nicely as possible. Unfortunately, during the Soviet Union, everybody was equal and looked the same, and simple things like German boots, French scarves, and Italian coats were symbols of connection to power (as you had svyazy-connection to get it). During the seventy years of Communist power, this idea stuck in the minds of Russian people that having foreign clothes will bring you closer to power. The better you look, the more respect you will get.</p>
<p>Remember that in modern Russia, if you dressed like a normal person (casual jeans and t-shirt) and go to any organization or governmental office to ask for something, nobody will take you seriously. They will be very rude with you, and you will not be able to get what you want. Everybody plays by these rules. Unfortunately, only if you look expensive, if you have an expensive telephone, etc., they will be very polite with you, being afraid of you as you could be somebody very important. Otherwise, you must be prepared for rudeness and a long time of waiting for things to be done.</p>
<p>This is another reason why mink coats are so popular among regular Russian people. If you are working in an office in Moscow or Saint Petersburg, the question “How is it that you still don’t have a mink coat—are you insane?” is a regular question among women. That’s why half of the women you see who are dressed in mink coats bought it by taking bank credit in order to look not worse than others.</p>
