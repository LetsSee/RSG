<h1>Chapter 4</h1>
<h1>Russian Guides</h1>
<p>Being a guide is a serious and respectable profession in Russia because it requires the same level of education and training as a teacher. If you want to work as a guide, you must study a lot and be well prepared for this job.</p>
<p>The reasons for this are historical and come from the period of the Soviet Union, when the country was not really opened for tourists, and each visitor was considered a spy trying to destroy the “wonderful” Communist regime. That’s why regular people weren’t allowed to communicate with representatives of the capitalistic world. So the selection of guides was a very serious and complicated process. At that time, it was very difficult (almost impossible) to start working as a guide with foreigners. In order to get access to them, you and your family had to be checked by KGB; your level of knowledge and your loyalty to USSR should be proven by long years of education and an active political life in Communist youth organizations and the Communist Party.</p>
<p>During soviet time, being a guide was a very prestigious profession—they were part of Russian elite, they were chosen from millions of people, and the government trusted them to form the image of the country for visitors. Guides had access to foreigners and locations that were closed for regular people, such as bars and restaurants and hotels. They had a chance to communicate with people who could tell them about life people didn’t know about. They had the chance to get gifts from foreigners that they would never find in Russia. But there was another side to this very prestigious work—guides were under total control by the KGB and had to write reports after each group and any contact with foreigners.</p>
<p>“One American delegation gave me a tip—ten American dollars for my work, and I had to run to the ladies room immediately, tear the money into small pieces, and flush them in the toilet. If I were caught with the money in my pocket, I could not only lose my job but also go to prison as it was forbidden to keep foreign money at that time,” said one of the most experienced guides.</p>
<p>Another story from a guide during the soviet period: “Every evening after working with tourists, I had to go to our guiding bureau (and it was only one in the city), enter a special room where a military man gave me a notebook with sewed pages, and I sat to write reports about my guests. My task was to describe our discussion, their questions and topics of interests. I wrote that they were really only interested in the Revolution, the history of the Communist Party, and the life of Lenin, and that my clients asked questions only about the Revolution, the Party, and Lenin. I wrote exactly the same text every day for almost twenty years.”</p>
<p>It was almost impossible to become a guide during the soviet time, and people who could do it felt and were very special in comparison with other regular people who didn’t have access to tourists, hotels, and restaurants.</p>
<p>But after the collapse of the Soviet Union, the situation didn’t change much. Of course KGB control disappeared, but all the license structure stayed the same as it was during the soviet time. Therefore, still twenty years after the Soviet Union collapsed; it is not enough to just know foreign language and history of the destination. In Russia (as it was twenty years ago), you have to study for it and prove your knowledge to become a guide. Usually, all of our guides study language and history in the linguistic or historical departments of universities for five years. Then you need to take guide courses organized by government organizations (for example in Saint Petersburg, it is organized by the guide association of Saint Petersburg Tourism Committee). Then after six months in these courses, you will get a license to work as a guide guiding regular panoramic-city sightseeing tours. But with only this license, you will not be able to guide excursions inside of museums in the city. After you get a general guiding license, you have to take courses organized by the museum and, during the final exam, prove you have a sufficient level of knowledge of this particular museum. Every museum in the city organizes their own courses and gives their own exams. Each year you have to take this course again and take the exam again to refresh your license for each museum.</p>
<p>Can you imagine the level of knowledge a guide has after having a master’s degree from a university, having taken courses and exams every year? That’s why we can proudly say that our guides are the most intelligent guides in the world. For example in Saint Petersburg, we have twenty main museums that are most popular among tourists (including Hermitage, Peterhof, Catherine Palace, Saint Isaac, Peter and Paul Fortress, Pavlovsk Palace, etc.), and guides have to take exams every year in all these twenty museums. In Moscow, there are not so many must-see attractions that require licensing (only Kremlin, Tretyakov Gallery, and Pushkin Museum of Modern Art), and as a result, guides in both cities are different. In Saint Petersburg, people who work as a guide work the whole year, and it is their main profession. In Moscow, it is very common for a guide to combine guiding with their other main profession, like language teacher or interpreter for corporations.</p>
<p>Guiding in Moscow may not be their main source of income, whereas in Saint Petersburg it is. As a result, the mentality and style of work is very different in these cities. For example, a guide job in Moscow is less prestigious than in Saint Petersburg. You can feel that, for a Moscow guide, this job is not their main income, and it is more hobby and that they give you a favor. Of course it is just a generalization; there are a lot of really good professional guides in Moscow—you just need to know where to find them.</p>
<p>Also when you are visiting both cities, you should be prepared that guides in Moscow are more entertainers (they give you information that you want to hear—some dirty and scandalous facts from history, some historical “yellow press” information). Meanwhile, Saint Petersburg guides are educating you—they tell you very interesting stories, and they make you want to hear more about the history of the subject. Usually, people at Saint Petersburg, after meeting with our guides, begin to study the history of Russia to get deeper knowledge.</p>
<p>In modern Russia, you must know that there are two different unofficial categories of guides:</p>
<ul style='font-family:IowanOldStyle-Roman;font-size:17pt;'>
<li>Tour guides (or tour leaders) are those who work on big cruise ships and give tours to mass touristic groups. Usually, these guides take full responsibility of the group from the very beginning till the end, fulfilling functions of the tour leader, the representative of the incoming company. This type of guides usually don’t have a very high salary, and they get their main income from commissions they get from souvenir shops; that’s why they try to bring groups there one way or another.</li>
<li>MICE guides—guides who never work on cruise ships but work in incentive, congress, and events sphere. They are the highest category of guides. They have all the licenses for all museums; they know the history of the city really well. With them, clients don’t feel like tourists—they feel like guests in the city and their guide is their host. Actually these guides never call their client tourists. They never bring guests to a shop (if it was not discussed before). I would call these guides companions of guests who know the city very well and who can guide all tours in all museums.</li>
