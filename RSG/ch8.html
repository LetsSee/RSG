<h1>Chapter 8</h1>
<h1>Living Situation and Hotels in Russia</h1>
<p>In the big cities of Russia, most people live in apartments. If you were lucky, you got your apartment during privatization; if not, then you are probably struggling to pay off a mortgage or pay back friends and relatives. Real estate in Russia is very expensive in Saint Petersburg and Moscow. Those who currently buy apartments using credit find that they usually end up paying three times the actual value for the apartment with their thirty-year mortgage because interest rates in Russia are so high. So how do people live?</p>
<p>The average flat is two rooms. This literally means there are two rooms, not two bedrooms plus other living spaces. Of course there is then a kitchen and bathroom as well. Most rooms in the flat serve a dual purpose—i.e., living room/bedroom or office/bedroom. It is very rare that someone can afford a flat that each room serves only one purpose. That being said, the furniture is almost always multifunctional as well. I don’t think I have seen a single couch that doesn’t also turn into a bed!</p>
<p>Many people live with their parents. Young people often don’t move away when they go to university. Even when young couples get married, they may still live with either person’s parents. Also people choose to live where they have an available apartment even if it means they must commute several hours each day to and from work.</p>
<p>Another option is to rent. Renting is also very expensive, and you don’t get much space for your dollar. A single-room apartment, around thirty square meters, in the historical center of Saint Petersburg, without a new renovation, costs around $1,000 per month; in Moscow, the price is almost three times as high. Young people who often no longer want to live with their parents will rent an apartment together if their incomes allow it, but it is like living with a roommate, and you may be sharing that single room!</p>
<p>A special feature in the Saint Petersburg real estate market is the komunalka or communal flat. This is where individuals own separate rooms in a flat but share a kitchen, bathroom, toilet, and entryway. In each room, there may be a different number of people, from a single person to a whole family. Also the size of the komunalka may differ; some are four or five private rooms where there are others that are complete floors of buildings, around twenty rooms off a single corridor with one large kitchen and a very scary bathroom situation.</p>
<p class='maya'>Maya’s personal experience:</p>
<p class='maya'>It may surprise some people, but I did a little communal living myself. I was very lucky that my neighbors were friendly, quiet, relatively clean, and not alcoholics or drug addicts. I had heard horror stories about different communal flats, but my experience for the most part was pleasant. The flat I lived in had five private rooms, two of which housed families with small children. We were all rather young, so we seemed to get along fine. I think the biggest problem was waiting for the toilet to be free, but it wasn’t often such a problem. However, I have since moved up to a single-room apartment, and I don’t plan to go back to communal living, ever. It was a real Russian experience, but not one that I need to repeat or actually recommend.</p>
<p class='maya'>There are some wonderfully unique things about Russian apartment life. For example, the hot water that runs through the pipes in the kitchen and bathrooms doesn’t come from a boiler in the building but is pumped throughout the city. This has created some devastating accidents when these old pipes break and cars and people fall into holes of boiling water. It is also a problem in the summertime that the water gets shut off for several weeks at a time. It used to be that people left the city during the summer, so it wasn’t such a problem. Now you must put up with cold showers or install a small instantaneous water heater. You also cannot control the temperature in your apartment because it is heated by water that is once again pumped through the city into your radiator. You cannot decide when to turn them on in the fall or turn them off in the spring. There are knobs so you can close them off completely but that is all. Many of the older buildings in the center have not been updated very well. There may be all sorts of electrical and plumbing problems due to the fact that things are just really old.</p>
<h2>Hotels in Russia</h2>
<p>When visiting Russia, remember that twenty-two years ago was the Soviet Union with Communist values—everyone was equal and being modest and poor were qualities to be proud of. Restaurants, fashion, and hospitality were for capitalistic enemies. The more simple life you had the better, and of course, it is reflected in the tourism sphere.</p>
<p>During the Soviet Union, hospitality in the opinion of modern people did not exist in Russia. Hotels and restaurants were not for customers; customers were dreaming to get putevki(special allowance to take a trip) to the sanatorium or stand in line to visit restaurants. That’s why the attitude of the hotel and restaurant staff was completely opposite from what it should be. They were czars, not listening to clients. There are very regular hotels for the proletariat and hotels for foreigners. Every city had an Intourist Hotel—a hotel where all foreigners had to stay. Everything was very simple. Regular people couldn’t enter hotels like Astoria or Grand Hotel Europe.</p>
<p>Of course, after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, when Russia became open, it was unacceptable for foreigners with money to stay in ugly soviet hotels, and one by one, international chains started to appear in Russia.</p>
<p>Now you will find all of the most famous international hotel chains in Russia—from Accor hotels to Four Seasons, but of course they are concentrated basically in Moscow and Saint Petersburg. During the last twenty years, all old hotels have been renovated and given over to be managed by international chains. A lot of new hotels were built specially for international chains, and also a lot of new Russian hotels were built.</p>
<p>By staying in a chain hotel , you know what to expect. If you chose Holiday Inn, you know their standards, and there will be no surprises for you.</p>
<p>Remember that in other Russian cities, there is not such a wide choice of international hotels—Rezidor Hotels are opening a lot of Park Inns, Marriott is planning a lot of Courtyard Hotels, Accor is opening Ibis in the biggest Russian cities in Siberia and other regions. However, there is still a lack of international five-star hotels in other cities.</p>
<p>Recently, a lot of Russian hotels have opened, but here you must be careful. It is very often that rich people open a hotel and work with Russian corporations for conferences, etc., but for foreigners, their standards may not be good enough. Therefore, please think first before choosing a Russian hotel. Do some research and check professional opinions; sometimes what you see in pictures is not the same as what you get in reality (it can be worse or better).</p>
