<h1>Chapter 2</h1>
<h1>Arriving to Russia—Your Visas and Passing Through Customs</h1>
<p>The most painful part of traveling to Russia is probably the visa process. It is time consuming and, sometimes, very frustrating. As you are planning your trip to Russia, you also need to think about getting your visa, which is better done sooner than later. Once you have booked your hotel or received an invitation from the company or person inviting you, you can begin this process.</p>
<p>The first thing to think about is where you are going to apply for your Russian visa. Cost, requirements, and time to complete the visa can vary as to where you are applying from. Once you have decided where you will get your visa, you must visit the website for that specific Russian consulate. For example, if I am applying for a visa in Seattle, Washington, I should visit the Russian consulate site for Seattle. Many of the Russian consulates in the US no longer allow you to personally mail in your visa; you must either go through an agency, which adds at least $100 to the cost of your visa, or you must be able to walk the visa to the consulate yourself and be prepared to wait in line.</p>
<p>As soon as you have chosen your consulate, look at the list of documents they may require. Depending on the reason for your visit to Russia, they can ask you for AIDS test results, extra photos, proof of finances, etc. If you don’t have all these documents correct, they will refuse your visa, so please read the website’s information very carefully as it can change without notice.</p>
<p>Filling out the actual application now isn’t very difficult because it is done online, and the site gives hints as to what exact information they are asking for. Be sure to check all dates and personal information very carefully because if there are mistakes it can also cause your visa to be rejected!</p>
<p>When you have all your documents together and the application filled out, before you send them, be sure you double or even triple check everything! If you are going through an agency, they will check your documents again, but if you are walking your application to the consulate, the responsibility is all on you. Be sure you are not trying to get your visa at the very last minute because one never knows what can happen with the mail. You should also be aware of any holidays. The consulates do not work on Russian holidays or holidays of the country they are located in. This can cause huge problems if you are in a hurry to get your visa!</p>
<p>Lastly, be sure to double-check your visa as soon as you get it to make sure there are no mistakes with dates of entry, birthday, and passport number. Such mistakes could cause you to be denied entry to Russia once you reach the passport control after your flight!</p>
<p class='maya'>First person advice from Maya:</p>
<p class='maya'>I have received seven visas to Russia and can tell you that every year this process is somehow different. I have received my visas in the US and Ukraine where although the forms are the same, the process, extra documents, photo size, and processing times are different. I cannot reiterate enough the importance of carefully reading the site of the Russian consulate you are applying to. Also, there are different rules for different countries. When I get my visa in Ukraine, it takes ten working days because I am an American, but if I were European it would only take three working days! This is because of the reciprocity based on Ukrainians who want American visas.</p>
<h2>Upon Arrival</h2>
<p>No matter how you arrive to Russia—plane, boat, train, or bus—you must go through passport control and customs. This process is not nearly as long as, say, in Newark airport, but still, you should be prepared for it.</p>
<p>When you arrive at the airport, the first thing you will do is go through passport control. While standing in line, you will notice that Russians traveling in groups switch lines often so that they get the shortest line. It is really frustrating, but there is nothing that can be done about it since the airport doesn’t set up a single-line maze. It used to be before going to the passport control window, you had to fill out a migration card, but as of this year, it is done automatically by the passport control when they scan your documents. Do not lose this tiny piece of paper! When you arrive at your hotel, they will use it to register you with the local authorities (a holdover from the soviet era), and you must give this paper back when you pass through passport control on your way out of the country! IF you happen to lose this paper, you will pay a fine and will have to deal with some unpleasantries from customs.</p>
<p>Next, collect your luggage. This can be a tedious process because it usually takes baggage handlers a long time and then the Russians trying to get their luggage are often very rude and pushy. Once you have your luggage, proceed through the green lane if you have nothing to declare, and then, you are free to meet your party and explore Russia. If your luggage doesn’t come, you will have another experience with Russian bureaucracy. You will need to fill out in duplicate a form describing your luggage and what it contained and put a monetary value on the items inside (this is for customs). On this form, you will need to include your hotel information so that the luggage can be delivered to you. You should also inform your hotel so that they can call the airport for you to check on whether your luggage has arrived or not.</p>
<p class='maya'>Personal story from Maya:</p>
<p class='maya'>When I first moved to Russia, I had all my things in two large suitcases, neither of which arrived with me! I had to wait two days for my things to arrive, but they did come. I had never been so happy to see clean socks and underwear in my life!</p>
<p class='maya'>After you have received your luggage, if you are continuing on to another city, you will have to check in again and hand your luggage back for it to meet you at your final destination.</p>
