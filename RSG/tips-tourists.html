<h1>Planning Your Trip—Moscow vs. Saint Petersburg</h1>
<p>Be prepared to spend time in traffic—remember that the Russian government is located in Moscow; that’s why traffic can be blocked when politicians are moving around the city.</p>
<p>If you don’t want to waste time in traffic jams on the way from the airport, always use airport expresses that connect airports with city center.</p>
<p>Saint Petersburg must be seen during white nights, but hotel rates are very high during this period. That’s why you should plan your visit before the first of June or after the first of July. You will have the same experience of white nights, but hotels will cost less.</p>
<p>Saint Petersburg is more comfortable for individual tourists—all street signs, city maps, metro plans, and signage are in Russian and English. This is because here we have more historical sights and attractions.</p>
<p>It is very easy to enjoy all the sights in Saint Petersburg. Almost all of them are located in the very city center within walking distance from each other.</p>
<p>When visiting Moscow, make sure that you visit the Red Square, Kremlin cathedrals, and metro stations.</p>
<p>Remember that Saint Basil’s Cathedral is more impressive from the outside. If you visit the Kremlin cathedrals, you will be a little disappointed comparing Saint Basil’s Cathedral with them.</p>
<p>Never leave Saint Petersburg without visiting Hermitage and Palace Square, the Church of Our Savior on Spilled Blood, Saint Isaac’s Cathedral, Peterhof Park, and the Amber Room in Catherine’s Palace.</p>
<h1>Arriving to Russia—Your Visas and Passing Through Customs</h1>
<p>Always start to prepare documents as early as possible. It is recommended to start the process fifty days prior to arrival to Russia.</p>
<p>If you have a regular passport and a diplomatic passport, use your regular passport as the process will be easier.</p>
<p>When applying for a visa, take into consideration Russian holidays (New Year and May both have long periods of holidays) when consulates are closed.</p>
<p>For individual travelers, it is recommended to ask agencies that assist with applying for visas. It will cost you more, but you will save a lot of time and energy. Especially if it is actually for the United States and Canada.</p>
<p>You will need to send the following information to hotels or DMC to get visa support papers: full passport name, passport number, validity of passport, date of birth, and citizenship.</p>
<p>Russian consulates in some countries require the original visa support papers (not email versions, copies, or faxes), so plan additional time for it.</p>
<h1>Traffic and Transportation</h1>
<p>Very seldom (and never in small towns) taxi drivers accept credit cards; you can pay only by rubles.</p>
<p>Taxi Drivers don’t speak English.</p>
<p>When you are taking a taxi, check the price in advance; never agree to pay by kilometers or time—sometimes drivers take a long route or traffic can make you pay a fortune.</p>
<p>Sometimes you will see people catching private cars on the street; it is not legal, but still a lot of people use it to get a cheap ride. It is absolutely not recommended for foreigners.</p>
<p>Taxi services (dispatchers) don’t speak English. It is better to ask your hotel and restaurants to book a taxi for you. However, it will be more expensive for you than if you call by yourself.</p>
<p>In Saint Petersburg at Pulkovo 2, there is an official taxi desk where it is recommended to book a taxi. There are two different desks with the same name; they use the same cars. But if you come to the desk on the right side, you get one price; if you go to the left, you get a price twice lower. That’s why please check rates before confirming a car. The average price for an economy-class taxi from the airport to the city center is EUR 30. Never take an unofficial taxi in the airport because it will cost you a fortune; they will switch on the counter, and you will have to pay a lot.</p>
<p>In other cities (not Moscow or Saint Petersburg), it is strongly recommended to book your transfer in advance with your hotel or travel agent. It will be much more comfortable for you, safer, and will cost less.</p>
<p>When you take a train to Vladivostok, prepare yourselves to see al Russia that is very different from Moscow and Saint Petersburg. Life there is much slower and calmer, and you will see unlimited Russian dimensions and unique beautiful nature.</p>
<p>When you are going to take the Trans-Siberian train, plan to stop in every town for not longer than two days. In Irkutsk, you can spend three days.</p>
<p>Pay attention that toilets are not very comfortable in the trains; they are closed twenty minutes before and after each stop.</p>
<p>Not every carriage has a shower (actually, it is seldom when they have it).</p>
<p>The restaurant carriage works according to local time, and you need to adjust for it.</p>
<p>Don’t buy meat pies that they sell on the platforms of the station—it is not safe. You can buy vegetables there and fruits.</p>
<p>During stops, check the time of the train’s stay, and don’t miss your train.</p>
<p>You can pay only by cash in the trains.</p>
<h1>Russian Guides</h1>
<p>Always hire a tour guide! Without him, you will not be able to understand the city and get the full picture about its history and the present.</p>
<p>Always go to museums like Kremlin, Hermitage, Catherine Palace and park with a guide—they will help you save time standing in line, they will show you the most efficient route inside of the site to see maximum of most important exhibits. It is very easy to get lost in Hermitage, and looking for an exit, you will miss impressionists, Italian art, or something very important.</p>
<p>Sometimes you can find guides standing near the entrance to the Kremlin or other sights offering you guiding. Always check their guide license as sometimes it can be a fake guide who will disappear after you pay them.</p>
<p>You can visit Saint Isaac’s Cathedral or Church of Our Saviour on Spilled Blood without ordering a guide in advance as every thirty minutes there are English-speaking groups and tours in English. But it is valid only for individual tourists, and there is no guarantee that there will be enough English local guides for everybody.</p>
<p>Before starting your tour, tell the guide what particularly you want to hear about—general tour around the museum with main exhibits or you want hear about a certain period of history or something particular. The more details you give, the more efficient and interesting your tour will be.</p>
<h1>Art</h1>
<h2>Museums</h2>
<p>Try to get your tickets to museums and performances in advance or online. This will save you from having to wait in line, which can be extremely long during the high tourist season. This is especially truefor Hermitage and Catherine Palace in Saint Petersburg and Kremlin in Moscow.</p>
<p>Double-check museum schedules! Some museums have days off (the Hermitage is closed on Mondays) or special hours of operations during holidays. For private collections, you may even need to call and make an appointment.</p>
<p>When going to museums, be sure to wear comfortable footwear as there may not be places to sit down and rest your weary feet! Those lovely antique chairs in the Hermitage are not for sitting!</p>
<p>Be sure to give your coats and large bags to the wardrobe! At theaters, you will not be allowed into the hall with your overcoat/winter coat; the lovely ticket ladies will turn you away. At museums, you will also be told to go hang up your coat! Just don’t leave anything of value in those items you leave behind!</p>
<p>You cannot bring water or any liquids to the museums.</p>
<p>You will need to go through security check when entering all museums.</p>
<p>It’s not allowed to use mobile phones in the museums.</p>
<p>Some museums like Catherine, Yusupov Palace, and Peterhof ask you to wear special slippers that are protecting the floor from damage.</p>
<p>Basically all museums have started to offer radio guides.</p>
<p>Some museums have sanitary days (they can be changed during the year)—it means additional days off.</p>
<p>Only main museums allow handicapped people. All other museums are not friendly for disabled people. Please check if there is a ramp.</p>
<p>Entrance fee for locals and foreigners are different.</p>
<p>Children under eighteen, students, and pensioners are free in basically all museums.</p>
<h2>Literature</h2>
<p>There are a lot of very popular walking tours connected with places where famous authors lived. For example, the most popular is the Dostoevsky’s world walking tour, where you see all the locations described in his books—you see the apartments where he lived and monuments to him and his characters. There are tours devoted to Tchaikovsky, Tolstoy, and Pushkin.</p>
<p>Moving around the city, you will find a memorial plaque on almost every building saying that in this place lived this or that writer, artist, performer, general, or some otherwise important person.</p>
<p>In order to understand Saint Petersburg or Moscow better, it is strongly recommend to read such books as Anna Karenina, Crime and Punishment, War and Peace, and Master and Margarita. If you read it before visiting Russia, you will understand more about the atmosphere and the Russian way of thinking.</p>
<p>A must-see in Saint Petersburg is the Dom Knigi or house of books located inside the historical Singer Building. Drink coffee on the second floor in the cafe with amazing view to Kazan Cathedral.</p>
<p>In Moscow, you must visit the famous Library of Lenin—the second biggest library in the world.</p>
<h2>Theater</h2>
<p>There is no dress code for the theater; however, we certainly recommend not going in jeans and a t-shirt.</p>
<p>Be sure to give your coats and large bags to the wardrobe! At theaters, you will not be allowed into the hall with your overcoat/winter coat; the lovely ticket ladies will turn you away. At museums, you will also be told to go hang up your coat! Just don’t leave anything of value in those items you leave behind!</p>
<p>Russian people love classical theater (opera, ballet, etc.); meanwhile, musicals are not so popular. It is very seldom when you find famous international musicals in Russia. Even if they are brought to Russia, they are not successful and don’t last long.</p>
<p>All theaters have holidays during July, August, and September.</p>
<p>Schedules of performances are known not earlier than three months in advance.</p>
<p>June is the period of the White Nights festival in Saint Petersburg, so all tickets sell out very fast—that’s why you need to buy them in advance.</p>
<p>Mariinsky and Bolshoi theaters have three stages each at this moment, so always check which stage your performance takes place. The most impressive are the historical stages, especially as Bolshoi’s renovation was finished only last year.</p>
<h1>Money and Shopping</h1>
<p>Almost all restaurants can accept Visa and Mastercard, however it is a good idea to check if their machine is working as sometimes the connection maybe down. American Express is rarely accepted in restaurants and hotels. Discover card or JTC are not accepted anywhere in Russia.</p>
<p>You can find ATM machines everywhere, so you don’t need to exchange and bring rubles with you. ATMs in Russia don’t charge fees, but know that your bank charges exchange-rate fee and out of network fee. Many Russian banks may have a “sister” bank or agreement with European or American banks, this is something to look into before leaving home.</p>
<p>Shops are opened from ten to ten, seven days a week.</p>
<p>Russia is famous for black caviar, but now it is very expensive as Caspian Sea is closed for the repopulation of sturgeon and ecological reasons.</p>
<p>Never buy black caviar if you are from the United States—you will not be able to bring it to the country.</p>
<p>Remember that clothes are much more expensive in Russia than in Europe and US, and that’s why it is better not to buy it here.</p>
<p>Vodka is a very popular Russian souvenir, but if you want it, choose something different than Russian Standard Vodka as you can buy it now in any city at almost the same price. Buy vodka at a regular grocery store.</p>
<p>Cigarettes are very cheap in Russia, but the quality is low.</p>
<p>Flea markets and farmers markets are famous for pickpockets—be careful.</p>
<p>Bring from Russia—Russian chocolate, Russian sparkling wine which is not worse than Spumante.</p>
<p>According to new law, you can buy alcohol only before 10:00 p.m. in Moscow and before 11:00 p.m. in other cities.</p>
<h1>Living Situation and Hotels in Russia</h1>
<p>Seasons in Moscow differ by days of the week. Monday–Thursday is always aheavily occupied period, and the rooms cost more. Friday–Sunday rates can be a third of the price ofduring the week. So plan your trip for weekends if you want to save money.</p>
<p>In Saint Petersburg, high season is in June during white nights, so try to avoid this month if you are not ready for high hotel rates.</p>
<p>Remember that air conditioners are not as popular as in the US in hotels, so your room may not be as cold as you are used to having at home.</p>
<p>We have 220-volt electricity in Russian and a different plug, so don’t forget to take adapters. Even if you forget, you will be able to get one at the reception in four- to five-star hotels.</p>
<p>A lot of hotels are located in a historical building that cannot be changed—that’s why rooms can be different in shape and size.</p>
<h1>Restaurants and Nightclubs</h1>
<h2>Restaurants</h2>
<p>If you want to eat in a normal (not fancy) place, ask how long the restaurant is opened. If it is older than one year, the chances that it is a really good place are higher.</p>
<p>When you ask for recommendations from regular people, they will recommend to you places that may not be interesting for you because they are new for Russia but for a foreigner is a usual place.</p>
<h2>Wine Culture</h2>
<p>All sparkling wine is called champagne in Russia.</p>
<p>Usually, Russian people drink semisweet or sweet sparkling wine. Very seldom dry or brut.</p>
<p>Sovetskoe Shampanskoe is the most popular brand of Russian sparkling wine.</p>
<p>Abrau Durso is the main Russian producer of sparkling wine.</p>
<p>For Russian people, champagne is a symbol for New Year and birthday.</p>
<p>Champagne and wine are a drink for ladies; men drink wine very seldom.</p>
<p>A very popular drink during New Year is nonalcoholic champagne for children.</p>
<p>It is very fancy to open an inoteka (wine bar), but usually, the selection is very small.</p>
<p>All restaurants have huge wine lists, but more than half of the list is absent.</p>
<p>Glut wine (mulled wine) appeared only five years ago but became very popular during winter season.</p>
<h2>Nightclubs in Russia</h2>
<p>Going to a nightclub, be aware that a lot of club visitors are underage (in Russia it is sixteen years old).</p>
<p>When planning to go to a club, take cash with you as not all clubs accept credit cards.</p>
<p>There is a lot of smoke inside clubs, so for people who don’t smoke, it is not very comfortable.</p>
<p>In many city guides, you will find a lot of advertising for nightclubs, but they are oriented towards male foreigners (and they don’t mention it in ads), so check with locals to find out what type of club it is. This means they are more likely to be stripclubs or topless clubs.</p>
<h1>People</h1>
<h2>People and Religion in Russia</h2>
<p>Visiting Russian orthodox churches you must be very quiet inside; no noise is allowed.</p>
<p>Drunk people are not allowed to enter churches.</p>
<p>Women cannot enter the church without covered heads, and no short skirts.</p>
<p>Men should not wear shorts or caps in the church.</p>
<p>In Russian churches, we always stand during the service; we don’t have chairs or benches like in Catholic churches. So be aware of it if you are planning to listen to the whole service.</p>
<p>It is not allowed to take pictures inside of the church.</p>
<p>Speaking on mobile phones is strictly forbidden, so turn off your telephone when entering the church.</p>
<p>Remember, this is someone’s holy place; whether you follow this religion or not or agree with the politics of it or not, you should respect that, for others, it is sacred.</p>
<h2>Russian People and Politics</h2>
<p>Don’t make and participate in any unauthorized political manifestation. In Russia, it is forbidden to have any meetings if you don’t have the government approval for it. Even if you personally don’t have trouble, the company who sent your visa support papers and guaranteed your program in Russia will have problems.</p>
<p>It is not recommended to criticize the Russian politic system in front of local people. You need to know that even if Russians don’t like the current political situation and they always complain about it, they will never accept any criticism and negative comments from anybody outside the country. It is a very strange form of patriotism and national pride, and it is very difficult to explain, but this is a fact—you just don’t need to try it.</p>
<p>A lot of people from older generations still miss the Soviet Union, thinking that life was better at that time. If you discuss this question with them, be very patient—you will hear a lot of stories of how life was better—and never criticize them.</p>
<h2>Telephone and E-mail Culture in Russia</h2>
<p>Dialing numbers from Russia—dial + (not 00) then country code without zeros, city code, and then number.</p>
<p>Ask your Destination Management Company or agent to prepare telephones with prepaid SIM cards for every member of your event team. You can rent it, but it is much easier to buy a new one. Using local SIM cards for your team during an event will save you a fortune as roaming in Russia is one of the most expensive in the world.</p>
<h2>Toilets in Russia</h2>
<p>We don’t have toilets in the metro. You can spend hours there changing stations but will not find toilets.</p>
<p>If you are in the city center, the most popular toilets for regular people are the toilets of McDonald’s. It is free and always clean. Sometimes the line to the toilets there is longer than the line to the counter.</p>
<p>When you need to usea toilet in a train station or airport (not in Moscow and Saint Petersburg), you will find toilet paper near entrance. You will need to take some of it with you as you go to the stall.</p>
<p>It is very often when toilets are paid in department stores, trains stations, and airports.</p>
<p>If the toilet is free, it is horrible.</p>
<p>We have biotoilets in the city centers in Moscow and Saint Petersburg.</p>
<p>In general, public bathrooms are disgusting even if you pay to use them! Take with you baby wipes and hand sanitizer everywhere. You never know if there will be enough toilet paper or soap to wash your hands with. Also be prepared to hold your nose!</p>
<h1>Holidays, Customs, and Traditions</h1>
<p>If you plan to visit Saint Petersburg in June, plan your stay for the twentieth of June (or around that date—the date can change) to see the scarlet sails. You will never see the same celebration anywhere else in the world.</p>
<p>Starting in the middle of April, repetitions of the military parade take place in Moscow. During these practices, all streets are blocked for military machines, so be prepared for it and plan to use the metro during these days.</p>
<p>Visiting Russia during holidays can be a wonderful experience, but try to book hotels and travel in advance as Russian people also like to travel at this time.</p>
