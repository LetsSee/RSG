<h1>Chapter 3</h1>
<h1>Traffic and Transportation</h1>
<h2>Traffic in Russia</h2>
<p>One of the most painful topics for locals and for tourists is traffic in the big cities in Russia. Moscow is the biggest city in Europe, and Russia has one of the fastest developing economies in the world; both are reasons for the huge traffic problems plus the lack of infrastructure and corruption in the public-works building sphere.</p>
<p>Traffic in big cities is very complicated and bad. Drivers do not take turns! There seem to be no civilized rules, and it can be very dangerous. It is very often that traffic jams are caused by people who are in a hurry and try to cross the intersection on a yellow light then blocking the intersection for the cross traffic. Also people will try to turn from nonturn lanes and drive where there is no lane at all (sometimes even on the sidewalk!). There is a “me first” mentality, and especially if you have an expensive car, the other drivers should get out of your way!</p>
<p>Do you know that Moscow has more Lamborghinis and Bentleys than in any other city? While visiting Russia, you will see the world’s best cars and a lot of them. You will see a lot of expensive cars on the street, but remember that the majority of the have been bought with credit. Ten years ago, banks were not so ready to give credit for cars, but now almost everybody buys them with credit. There are many cars causing horrible traffic. You must be prepared for it. Both of the capitals have extreme problems with infrastructure and are not prepared to deal with the influx of personal vehicles.</p>
<p>In Moscow and Saint Petersburg, all politicians drive with blue lights on the roof of their cars. These extremely “important” people, such as governors and mayors, have the road cleared before them and can sometimes completely stop traffic for twenty minutes before they ever arrive to that point. This then causes a terrible backup of traffic around and behind their route.</p>
<p>Another problem in the big cities is lack of parking space. In Moscow, you can see people park their cars on the sidewalks and in moving traffic lanes. This of course brings a lot of traffic problems. The government is trying to tow cars and fine the drivers, but it doesn’t seem to help because there physically isn’t any place to park. Beginning this year in Moscow, we have a new system of fines by police registering these cars, but it hasn’t helped at all. People prefer to pay the penalty but keep their car where it is comfortable for them.</p>
<p>Russian people love big cars in cities; even if it is uncomfortable with narrow streets and no parking space, still they love it. Mini Coopers or Smart cars are extremely unpopular and are considered to be cars for women and gays. In the Russian mind, the bigger and more expensive the car you have, the cooler you are (even if you spent all your money for the first payment and you have to spend all your salary to pay the credit and for maintaining your car).</p>
<p>Officially traffic in Russia is on the right side, but if you go to Siberia and the Far East, you will find that more than half of cars have a right-side steering-wheels. It can be explained that all these cars are secondhand cars bought from Japan. It is very dangerous to drive them because drivers don’t see the road well, but it is not forbidden by law. Foreign cars are more expensive and have better quality.</p>
<p>Visitors are always surprised to see so many stretch limousines in Moscow and Saint Petersburg. It is a really huge business; we have weddings every day, and you will find all colors and types of limos. You can find pink, metal, or even gold. Also it is funny that you will find parked limos which you can just rent as a taxi from the street.</p>
<p>I always hear these questions from my clients, “Why are Russian cars so dirty? Don’t you wash them at all?” Yes, cars look dirty, but the reason is not that we don’t wash them—we just don’t have clean streets. The edges of the roads also don’t have proper drainage, so when it rains, the water and dirt just flow into the streets. During the winter, there is a big problem with snow removal as well. One would think in a country such as Russia that receives so much snow, they would have come up with effective snow removal/cleaning of streets and sidewalks.</p>
<p>Car Rental is not as developed as in other countries. For foreigners, it is very difficult to drive in Russia, especially in the cities outside of Moscow and Saint Petersburg, as signs are in Russian only and sometimes they are not even installed. If you decided to rent a car, you will need to book it in advance as in Saint Petersburg there in no rental car offices, and in Moscow, not in all airports. It is not recommended to rent a car in Russia because of the style of driving and the difficulty of road conditions and signs. However, if you must rent a car, be sure to use a local navigation system because directions of streets can change, streets can be closed, or construction may block the way without notice.</p>
<h2>Taxi</h2>
<p>The taxi system in Russia is also not as developed as in other countries. There is no specific color for all taxis (i.e., yellow in NYC). They are trying to make them yellow, but it hasn’t happened yet. We don’t have separate lanes for taxis (as we have for public transport—taxis cannot drive there). The government is trying to put on every taxi the sign Taxi, but drivers don’t follow this rule and take them away in order not to pay taxes. It is also almost impossible to catch a taxi on the street as you do it in New York; you must go to a special parking lot near train stations. Actually, we don’t have so many such places—only at airports, train stations, some hotels, theaters, and big museums.</p>
<p>Being able to speak Russian makes it possible to speak with the taxi driver. You can always hear a lot of interesting things about politics, etc. For example, among the drivers with whom I’ve worked, there was a singer-tenor (winner of an international competition in 1995); a former owner of chain of car repairing centers whose businesses were illegally taken, and he was put in prison for two years; and a pianist who had to leave conservatory because of sexual harassment from a professor. All drivers have their own history, and it can help you to understand modern life if you speak with them.</p>
<h2>Other Forms of Transport: Bus, Metro, Trams, Trolleybus, and Taxi Bus</h2>
<p>As in most big cities, Moscow and Saint Petersburg have excellent public transport. Of course it is recommended to visit the metro stations in both cities because they are really monuments to Stalin’s era and are quite beautiful. It is very simple to buy a token for the metro at the station, and you may ride and switch lines without problems as long as you don’t exit. Many of the stations are very deep underground in both cities, so it is a little bit of an adventure getting to the trains themselves.</p>
<p>Buses, trams, and trolleybuses all cost the same price and go all over the city, but since they travel mostly the same roads as the cars, traffic can sometimes be a problem. Occasionally, overcrowding is also a problem, especially during rush hour or bad weather. If you aren’t traveling very far or the route is convenient, going by this form of transport can be quite nice. It isn’t really recommended for large groups, however.</p>
<p>The last category of transport is the marshutka or taxi bus. These small buses travel a specific route but stop at the request of the passenger. They are slightly more expensive, and the passenger must know where he needs to get off. The drivers of the buses also seem to have no regard for traffic laws, and riding can be quite the roller-coaster ride!</p>
<h2>Using Trains in Russia</h2>
<p>Being the biggest country in the world, Russia has one of the most complicated and longest systems of trains. Russia has the longest railroad in the world—the Trans-Siberian Railway that connects Moscow and Vladivostok (almost 10,000 km long). The most popular destinations are Trans-Siberian (it takes seven days to go from Moscow to Vladivostok).</p>
<p>Regular trains are not easy. There are several kinds of carriages (they differ by compartments that they include).</p>
<ul style='font-family:IowanOldStyle-Roman;font-size:17pt;'>
<li>Deluxe – room for two people, with shower and toilet. It is very seldom when it can be found on a train. We have one train between Moscow and Saint Petersburg and one going to Vladivostok. Sometimes you can charter such a train if you have a big group or buy seats from tour operators.</li>
<li>First class – compartment with two beds, but the toilet is outside and one for the whole carriage. Another name of this class is SV.</li>
<li>Second class – the same as first class but includes four beds (two of them are on the second level). The toilet is outside.</li>
<li>Third class (or platskard) – unwalled compartments of six beds.</li>
</ul>
<p>Trans-Siberian trains are one of the most popular routes among foreigners, but usually, tourists don’t travel it alone (as not so many people speak English in that part of Russia, and it is not so easy for tourists to organize everything here by themselves). That’s why it is recommended to buy a package from tour operators who professionally organize train trips to Vladivostok or Ulaanbaatar. You can check their offers and choose from different types of compartments and different trains, usually tour operators charter the whole deluxe-class trains and sell it to individual tourists. You can check schedules and make reservations on trains not worse than famous Orient Express trains.</p>
<h2>Traveling between Moscow and Saint Petersburg</h2>
<p>You can travel between Moscow and Saint Petersburg by airplanes and trains. We have flights every hour from all airports. The flight is about one hour long.</p>
<p>Another alternative is to travel by trains—you can take night trains (departing at midnight and arriving at eight in the morning) or you can take day trains. We always recommend taking new speed trains Sapsan from Moscow to Saint Petersburg. You will spend only four hours in the train, but you will depart from very city center and arrive to center. Even if you take a plane that is about an hour, you will have to spend about two hours for traffic at the airport, then to go through security and check in, and then spend time from airport to city center.</p>
<p>New speed trains to Sochi will start working this year.</p>
