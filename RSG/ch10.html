<h2>Why Do Russian People Look So Unhappy and Angry?</h2>
<p>One of the most popular questions from my clients is “Why do Russian people never smile and look so angry and unhappy?” And usually our answer is “But why should they smile?”</p>
<ul style='font-family:IowanOldStyle-Roman;font-size:17pt;'>
<li>For Russian people, a smile means something. If people smile at you, it means that they are glad to see you. We never smile without reason.</li>
<li>We don’t smile to strangers as other nations do. If you smile on the street to somebody, they will be surprised, asking “Do I know you?” or “Are you crazy/drunk?”</li>
<li>We don’t smile when working. You must look serious; otherwise, you will not be taken seriously. You will never see Russian politicians smiling. Because if you are smiling, it means that you are not taking it seriously or you don’t respect or you distrust another person.</li>
<li>We have a saying that goes “Real man never smiles” In the male sphere, it is not common to smile as it is symbol of weakness.</li>
<li>We smile to show our personal attraction. So if somebody at night smiles at you, that person really likes you.</li>
<li>It is not common to smile at a person whose eyes meet ours by chance. Americans will smile in this case, but Russians will turn their eyes away.</li>
<li>We smile sincerely. For different countries smiling is normal; it is a neutral level of politeness. In Russia, for us it is normal not to smile. If you are really glad to see a person or you know him, you smile. That’s why for Russian people, Americans seem slightlyt insincere. But if Russian people are smiling, it means a lot.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you look at Russian history (soviet period), you will see that due to different reasons, smiling was not common for the hospitality industry—waiters in restaurants or hotel receptionists would never smile at you. That’s why now in all exhibitions or hotel businesses, it is very easy to make people remember you—just smile. When you enter Four Seasons Hotel in Saint Petersburg, everybody smiles at you, and the first reaction is very strange—Russian people don’t feel comfortable. That’s why they teach their staff here to first make eye contact then smile.</p>
<p>For us, when we see somebody smiling at us when we are walking, our first reaction will be to check if everything is okay with us—if we don’t have something of our face or if our clothes are dirty.</p>
<h2>People and Religion in Russia</h2>
<p>The topic of religion is very sensitive in Russia. During the seventy years of the Soviet Union, all religion was officially forbidden. After the October revolution in 1917 and when Stalin came to power, many (almost all) churches and cathedrals were destroyed, and priests were sent to prisons. Some of the beautiful cathedrals that remained were turned into theaters, warehouses, or were allowed to fall into disrepair. In spite of such tough governmental policy, there were a lot of people who continued to believe and visited the few remaining small churches. Many people baptized their children but did it very discretely and told their children not to make it public. Of course, for the majority of the people, religion was a ridiculous holdover of the czarist regime that was supposed to be removed from the life of all “real” Communists.</p>
<p>But after the collapse of the Soviet Union and the start of democratic reforms in Russia, the situation changed. After 1991, the government decided to change course about their position on religion and started to support it and make it a more active part of Russian life. So in the nineties, hundreds of churches and cathedrals destroyed by the soviets were rebuilt and reclaimed. The symbol of resurrection of the Russian Orthodox church became Moscow’s Cathedral of Christ the Savior. It was the main cathedral before the revolution, but it was demolished in 1931. In this spot, they wanted to build the Palace of Soviets, but it didn’t happen because of lack of funds and the outbreak of World War II. Later it was transformed into the world’s largest open-air swimming pool. Only in the nineties came the decision to rebuild it, and the new cathedral was consecrated in 2000. Now it can hold around five thousand to six thousand at one time and is the tallest Eastern Orthodox church in the world and currently the largest operating Orthodox church in the world.</p>
<p>So now the position of Russian Orthodox church is very strong, and it plays an active role in the political and daily life of Russia. You can find newly built cathedrals and chapels in almost any town, village, or settlement. And as a result, more people have started to visit churches and follow orthodox traditions.</p>
<p>With the return of the Russian Orthodox faith, Christmas has become an official holiday in Russia and seventh of January is official day off. People now more actively celebrate Easter, baptize their children, and get married in the church (even if officially these marriages have no legal value). Even restaurants are catering to the church calendar by offering special menus during Lent.</p>
<p>A lot of people have become real believers since the change in political doctrine, but some of them are just following fashion as it became really fashionable to be religious. The strangest thing for Russians is the fact that politicians who were really active Communists and voted against the Orthodox church now became fanatically religious and can be seen standing in the firsts rows in the cathedrals during Christmas or Easter services (i.e., Putin, the former KGB agent now as president, goes to church and is always quite visible during religious holiday ceremonies). High religious holidays are also now shown on television on the state-run channels.</p>
<p>At this moment the Russian Orthodox church is very rich; they have a lot of land, buildings, and cathedrals returned to them from the state, and they earn a lot of money. Sometimes people are not really happy with the modern church when they see the simple priest driving the latest models of Lamborghini or Bentley. Generally, step by step, religion is entering our daily life and becoming a normal part of it.</p>
<p>We must also note that Russia is a multi-religion country, and we have a really huge Muslim and Jewish community. We have mosques and synagogues in Moscow, Saint Petersburg, and many other cities. Due to the fact that the Soviet Union included very different republics with very different religious beliefs, Russian people are very tolerant and use to different religions.</p>
<p>We know that it is very interesting to visit Russian churches as they are very beautiful and authentic, but you need to respect traditions and rules of behavior there.</p>
<h2>Russian People and Politics</h2>
<p>When talking about politics, we must admit that, in general, Russian people are very passive. People compare modern life with the life we had during the Soviet Union and in the nineties, and everybody agrees that from this point of view, daily life has become much better.</p>
<p>The main problem is that people don’t believe that they can change anything. In small towns far from Moscow, people don’t believe that their voice can decide anything; therefore, people don’t vote during any election, and thus the most active voting part or population are old pensioners voting for Communists.</p>
<p>The passive position of Russians can be explained by the seventy years of Communist regime, when nothing depended on the people, everything was decided by political bureaus, and regular citizens were supposed to just follow orders that they got from somebody in Moscow. Later it was the “crazy nineties” when people were fighting just trying to survive when the whole industry and all spheres of countries were falling apart. In the beginning of the twenty-first century, people somehow got used to stability in life (guaranteed job, having the opportunity to take credit, having the opportunity to travel), and people don’t want to lose it all. Plus people don’t believe that they can do anything, they don’t trust the results of elections, the court system, the police, etc.</p>
<p>At the same time, Russians don’t see a strong political leader who could replace the current president (due to very different reasons), and that’s why people think that there is nobody who could offer a better solution to the modern situation.</p>
<p>Moscow is very different from the other parts of Russia; all money and the most active and ambitious people are concentrated there, and that’s why people there are more politically active. After the last elections, intelligent people were very active and hoped for changes, but after the demonstrations of 2012, it became very difficult to organize public meetings and demonstrations to announce their wishes, but it is almost impossible to get permission for them. As a result, people don’t do it anymore.</p>
<p>During the last twenty years, only pensioners went to elections (that’s why the Communist Party is still very strong in the Russian government), but now in the big cities, young people are becoming more politically active and involved. Usually, it is the very young eighteen to twenty-three age group, and they fall under manipulation of politicians very quickly—so now we have a large number of youngsters who are either extremely pro or against the current political regime.</p>
<h2>Telephone and E-mail Culture in Russia</h2>
<p>Russia, like any other developed country, has a telecommunicating boom. Telecommunication companies are one of the fastest growing businesses in Russia. We don’t produce our own telephones, so all mobiles are imported to the country.</p>
<p>If you go to the US, on the way back, buy three new iPhones and sell them in Russia. By going so you will pay for your travel as new models are usually 50 percent higher than they are in US.</p>
<p>Remembering the chapter about Russian consumerism and wishing to follow fashion, you can understand the position of Russians about mobiles. For Westerners, it will sound stupid, but people in Russia always buy the most expensive telephone. Even if it costs twice more than your monthly salary, people will save money on food to buy an expensive phone because for them as a symbol of status. You cannot be a serious businessman if you still use the first model of the iPhone. It is absolutely natural for people to take credit in the bank to buy a new model of mobile to replace their six-month-old telephone.</p>
<p>Walking on the street, at a café, or in a restaurant, you will see that people talk on mobile all the time despite the fact that rates for telephone calls in Russia are one of the most expensive in the world.</p>
<p>Russians don’t use voice mail at all. If you are calling and this person is already busy on another line, he will interrupt the first telephone conversation to answer your call and tell you that he cannot speak right now, and after that he will call back to the first person he had original telephone conversation. Yes, mobile telephone calls are very important for people. If you have a meeting with people to discuss something very important and at the same time the cell phone rings, they will interrupt the meeting, answer the phone, and tell that they cannot talk right now—they are in a meeting. This is extremely annoy and seems rude to foriegners, but if they don’t answer the call the other person will keep ringing and ringing until they do.</p>
<p>Roaming in Russia is very expensive. You can have a Saint Petersburg SIM card and go to Moscow. In this case, you will pay for roaming almost at the same price if you were in Europe with this SIM card. It is simple better to have a different SIM for each city you go to.</p>
<p>E-mail culture in Russia has its own specifics.</p>
<p>For example, people never answer an e-mail as soon as they get it. It means that if you sent the e-mail, you will not get the answer “Thank you for the e-mail. I will reply to you during the day.” You will get a reply very unexpectedly—it can be in one day or in two weeks.</p>
<p>The same as voice mail, we don’t use autoreply. A person can go on a vacation for two weeks, and you will understand it only after he comes back and says that he was on vacation.</p>
<p>Very often, big companies (not American corporations) use e-mails at Gmail.com, Yahoo.com, and Mail.ru. Also it is often when people don’t put their contact information on the bottom of their e-mail (no cell phone, not even regular phone).</p>
<h2>Toilets in Russia</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, toilets are a big problem in Russia, and it has always been a problem here. During Communist time, this question was not for discussion; people were supposed to think about the victory of Communism, not about toilets. For us, this subject didn’t exist—it’s like people didn’t even use toilets at all.</p>
<p>The biggest elevator in the world is in Krasnodar, but toilets in the same building are just twenty holes in the cement floor.</p>
<p>In the new airports in Moscow and Saint Petersburg, toilets are OK, but in old terminals, toilets may not have toilet paper and never toilet-paper seats (it is rare when they even have toilet seats).You may also notice that the idea of “clean” in public bathrooms is quite different from your standards.</p>
<p>Even new buildings (like the airport in Sochi) and for the whole departure terminal, there are only two toilets.</p>
<p>It can be a very nice restaurant with really expensive furniture and expensive food, but toilets will be very simple and look very cheap.</p>
<p>The public toilet systems are usually blue-colored cabins that are standing near metro stations or near sights; they are one of the worst options, but you can use them in case of emergency. They cost around twenty rubles. Still, it’s better to find a restroom in a public building for the same price. The experience will be far less traumatizing.</p>
