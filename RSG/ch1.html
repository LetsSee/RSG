<h1>Planning Your Trip—Moscow vs. Saint Petersburg</h1>
<p>One of the largest arguments in the two biggest Russian cities is “Which of the cities is better?” There are lots of reasons for the never-ending debates as these two cities are completely different each with its own pros and cons.</p>
<p>For Muscovites, Saint Petersburg was always the depressingly slow city where you spend weekends if you want to visit Europe but you can’t afford the time and money for it or maybe you don’t even have a visa. For citizens of Saint Petersburg, Moscow is a place where you go to work and earn money, earn very good money.</p>
<p>Competition between these cities started immediately after the foundation of Saint Petersburg and it has never stopped. That’s why when visiting Russia, be prepared to see two different faces of Russia, two different mindsets, and two different lifestyles.</p>

<h2>Architecture: Eclectic vs. Imperial Style</h2>
<p>Historically, both cities were different. Moscow was a village that grew from a small settlement into the biggest city in Europe. Meanwhile, Saint Petersburg, from the very beginning, was created as the capital of the biggest country in the world with the target to impress and show the wealth and power of the Russian Empire.</p>
<p>Peter the Great, founder of Saint Petersburg, didn’t like anything traditionally Russian. Hewas fascinated by highly developed Europe (especially Amsterdam where he studied): therefore he decided to build a new European city as the capital of Russia. Especially for this reason, he invited the best Western architects to plan and build Saint Petersburg. Peter the Great made every Russian noble person and merchant build their residence in Saint Petersburg, and as a result, there are about six hundred incredibly beautiful palaces in Saint Petersburg and only a dozen in Moscow. Saint Petersburg had a general plan of development with big squares and wide prospects with separate districts for palaces of the czar’s family, for nobles, and for merchant houses. In some areas, streets don’t have names—just numbers in New York fashion.</p>
<p>Moscow was formed starting from the fortress Kremlin, where the czars sat and ruled, and the city grew around it in a circle (ring) form—Boulevard Ring, Garden Ring, and Moscow Ring Highway.</p>
