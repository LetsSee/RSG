<h1>Introduction</h1>
<h2>Russian People and Its History</h2>
<p>There is a lot of criticism and jokes about modern life in Russia, but foreigners forget that our modern reality is the result of events that took place in Russia during the last one hundred years. If you just recall tragedies that happened in Russia during this period and calculate the damages brought by it, you will be shocked. When you look at Russian history closer, you will understand us better and start to love and respect Russia.</p>
<p>Russian people respect and know their history very well. During secondary school, we study history quite deeply during those seven years. Plus, basically, all our holidays (like Victory Day, Independence Day, former revolution day, etc.) are connected with Russian history and well promoted by the government. So the Russian people are very proud of their history and culture, especially about the way the nation managed to survive all the historical events during the last century. Russians, in general, are very patriotic, even if sometimes it looks like they are not. Russians can complain about recent political or economic situations, but behind this façade and political bravado, you will find very strong and deep patriotic feelings. You should know that, while complaining to one another about the situation in Russia, Russians will never accept criticism from foreigners. For us, only people who went through all the tragedies we have had can judge us.</p>
<p>Did you know that almost two million Russians were killed and that almost three million morewere injured during the First World War? What was the damage to Russian economy and culture brought on by the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917? How many intelligent and progressive people were killed or were forced migrate during those years? How many people were killed in the gulag during Stalin’s regime of terror? (Almost twenty million were prisoners and almost three million were killed there.) What losses did we suffer during the Second World War? (Almost twenty-three million killed and nine million injured.)</p>
<p>Don’t forget that Russia managed to rise up after the Second World War to survive the perestroika and the collapse of the Soviet Union. And people who lived throughout the soviet regime, shut off from the world, managed to survive through the “crazy nineties” with its privatization and reconstruction . All of these people are our grandparents, mothers, and fathers who raised us, who remember all these horrible times. Of course, having such a background, modern Russians has become different from the US and Europe, who have suffered different and fewer tragedies.</p>
<p>Therefore, in order to understand Russian people and their strange form of patriotism, it is a good idea to learn more about our history and you will better understand what a huge amount of progress has happened in the country and inside of people’s minds in just twenty years. To help with a brief knowledge of history, I have included you a short list of important historical events that have taken place in Russia just in the twentieth century:</p>
