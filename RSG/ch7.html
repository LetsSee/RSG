<h1>Chapter 7</h1>
<h1>Russian Men and Women</h1>
<h2>Why Do Russian Women Always Wear High Heels and Full Makeup?</h2>
<p>When you ask foreigners what the main exported resources of Russia are, they always answer oil, gas, vodka, and add jokingly, women. The beauty of Russian women is known around the world. Visitors to Russia are always surprised to see that Russian women look like they are going to an Oscar night gala dinner even if they are just going to the grocery store or to throw away garbage.</p>
<p>Yes, Russian women always look great with high heels and full makeup, and they look great everywhere—in the museum during a four-hour walking tour, on the plane during an intercontinental flight, on the beach during vacations, even sweating at the gym. The main reason is there are more women in Russian than men. It is a fact that there are fewer men than women in Russia due to several reasons—stressful lifestyle., high rate of heart disease among men, and the biggest problem, alcoholism. The life expectancy rate for men in Russia is around sixty years old. Then there is the problem that the existing men are not exactly what women dream about. We still have the problem of alcoholism in Russia, and in general, male culture is not as sophisticated as in other countries. Women from childhood know that there are not enough men, but they are all still hoping to marry a prince. Everybody believes that they can meet their prince any second, anywhere—they need to be prepared for this moment. That’s why you see high heels and evening makeup on the sandy beach and Kim Kardashian copies in lines at the vegetable markets.</p>
<p>In Russia, there still exists this archaic idea (cultivated by the older generation) that women must get married and have their first child not later than twenty-five years old. In Russian medicine, we have the term “old-giving-birth” (starorodyashaya)—women who give birth after twenty-five. The situation for women becomes really tough after she turns thirty and still hasn’t married. In Russia, it is still something negative if you are not married by this age.</p>
<p>Of course, Moscow and Saint Petersburg are very different from other towns in Russia; there the above mentioned problems are not so exaggerated. In these cities, you will see very fancy men and beautiful, single, independent women. In small towns, it is enough for men to simply have regular job and not drink for him to find a wife. The selection of men is so limited in deep Russian citiesthat women must take what they can get.</p>
<p>Therefore, Russian women always look so done up because from childhood, they have been raised with idea that their main goal is to get married, have children, and create a household. With such strong competition, you must look your best in order to make your chances higher.</p>
<h2>Why Do Russian Men Look So Ugly?</h2>
<p>Another question often asked by clients is “Why are men so ugly in Russia?” The answer is the same as for the question “Why are Russian women so pretty?” It is the result of lack of men in our country. Why should a man try to look better, shave, groom themselves, and try to dress up if he knows that in any case he will find somebody and find somebody really nice? If you go to nightclubs, you will see that even the ugliest and most unpleasant men are leaving the club with really pretty girls because time is ticking away. Girls are afraid to be “old giving birth” and to be alone after turning thirty!</p>
<p>Therefore, there is no competition; Russian men know they will get a girlfriend no matter what. It is simply required from the man not to be a drunk, have a job, and then he is the perfect game for a future bride. Sadly, it is very often that women accept beating, adultery, and drinking, believing that they will not have a chance to find another husband.</p>
<p>At the same time, there is a stereotype among men that if you look well groomed, people will start thinking that you are gay. This is absolutely unacceptable among Russian men; it is better to look horrible and smell awful and behave like a pig than to have somebody think that you are gay. It is then funny that, at the same time, you will see a lot of men wearing stretch-tight t-shirts with funny prints, decorated with sparkles, as well as capris or Speedos on the beach. It is interesting that Speedos are more popular among men than swim trunks on the beach. This is usually a very funny sight for Americans to see. Just know that crowds of Russian men in small Speedos on beaches are not gays—they just don’t know that usually only gays like this look.</p>
<p>It is a good thing that life is changing in big cities, and in Russia, we have a new fashion. It is becoming more popular to look after yourself, go to the gym, buy nice clothes, etc. Step by step, a growing percentage of Russian men are becoming more civilized and handsome.</p>
<h2>Why Are Russian Women So Popular Abroad as a Wife?</h2>
<p>Fun fact: If you are a foreigner in a Russian bar, you have twenty times more chances to leave that night with a new girlfriend.</p>
<p>Another question is “Why do Russian women like to get married to foreigners?” I always answer, “It’s not what women would like—it’s that foreigners are happy to get a Russian wife.” Honestly, there are two answers to this question.</p>
<p>Firstly, for Russian women, family is the main priority. Maybe it is old-fashioned now, and people in big cities will not agree with it, but I am sure that on the inside, those women too would be happy to find Prince Charming and raise children together. Despite global emancipation, Russian people still have traditional views of male and female roles in a relationship. The Russian man is supposed to be a hunter and provide family with money, while the woman should be a housewife and care about raising the children. Of course, women use all opportunities to get an education and make a career, but still the main goal and dream is to get married and have a family.</p>
<p>Russian women are more reserved and friendly compared with emancipated Western women. It may seem very weird to foreigners, but Russian women will use all possibilities to save a marriage; they will forgive almost everything their husbands do in order to avoid divorce. Plus women are famous for being excellent housewives and good and loving mothers. In Russia, it is not common to have a housemaid; that’s why they have to learn from childhood how to do laundry, cook, clean house, etc. It is exactly these qualities that are very attractive for Westerners (additional to women’s beauty), and a lot of women dream of marrying a foreigner.</p>
<p>In Russian memory (left over from the Soviet Union—when any car was a luxury and people couldn’t travel abroad), all foreigners were considered to be rich people because they lived in separate houses or big flats, everybody had a car, etc. It is still the belief of many women. If you look at Russian men in other Russian cities, you will understand why women are ready to move to other countries without knowing whom they will meet. It is quite often that girls move to the United States just to get away from Russian reality. For girls from Russia in the ’90s, it was the only chance to have a good life (normal for a foreigner and luxury for them). For girls, it was a ticket to Western paradise. Others were (and are) just generally curious and fascinated by the unknown.</p>
<p>Another reason of popularity of marriage with foreigners is the reputation of Russian men. Unfortunately, it is true that it is difficult to find a nice man. Foreigners are reputedly much more caring and understanding; they are ready to listen and to treat one as a person and not as a servant.</p>
<p class='maya'>Maya’s personal experience</p>
<p class='maya'>As a foreign woman living in Russia, I have had some interesting experiences with Russian men. Firstly, every Russian man asks, if they compliment a woman or open the door for her, will they be sued for sexual harassment in the US. I, of course, explain that this is not true. Then of course when a man opens a door for me, I am confused as to what he is doing. I think he is opening the door for himself, but he is opening it for me and there is an awkward moment where I pause not knowing whether I should enter first or not. Men in the big cities seem to have appropriate manners most of the time. The idea of a woman “going Dutch” to pay for a date is completely unheard of. I believe it is a matter of pride for the man to be able to pay for the meal or coffee or whatever. I have actually been told it is a great affront to a person’s manliness to even offer to pay my part! Another interesting thing is that many Russian men are attracted to me because, being foreign, I seem somehow exotic to them. This is of course very funny for me since I am of Slavic descent and look like I belong in Russia.</p>
<p class='maya'>Although all men may not be handsome, charming, and intelligent, I feel that they respect women in general. This can be seen in the way they treat their mothers, grandmothers, and sisters. I think most men would say their grandmothers had a large influence on their lives and it shows. All this being said, if you are a Western woman, it is still very difficult to date a Russian man. Our mind-sets and priorities are very different and can cause lots of conflicts in a romantic relationship, but I think Russian men make good friends and colleagues.</p>
