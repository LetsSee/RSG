<h1>Chapter 5</h1>
<h1>Art</h1>
<p>Russia is blessed with a deep tradition in the classical arts. Russian writers, painters, musicians, and performers are recognized as some of the greatest around the world. In modern day Russia, the public takes pride in its artistic treasures: children study the classics at school, for example. When visiting Russia, one has the opportunity to walk in the footsteps of great artists and see their works performed or on the walls of some of the most famous museums in the world.</p>
<h2>Museums</h2>
<p>Of course in the larger cities of Russia, you can find wonderful art museums: Hermitage and the Russian Museum in Saint Petersburg and Tretyakov Gallery and Pushkin Museum in Moscow. These museums are famous the world over, but there are also other boutique museums. For example, choose your favorite Russian author, writer, or artist, and you can probably visit the flat in which he lived and see the actual instruments he used for his craft. Or perhaps you are more interested in the history of Russia or a particular city, then you could visit Peter and Paul Fortress (Saint Petersburg) to gain a vast understanding of why Peter the Great chose to build Saint Petersburg.</p>
<p>Many of the palaces and the surrounding parks have also been turned into a type of museum. One can tour such places as the Yusupov Palace and see the place where Rasputin was killed. On a visit to Catherine’s summer palace, one can see such amazing things as the Amber Room and tour the lovely gardens and imagine oneself living in a different time.</p>
<p>Many of the cathedrals that dot the great cities of Russia can be visited as well (some even free of charge!). In Saint Petersburg, the must-sees are Saint Isaac’s and Kazansky cathedrals and the Church of Our Saviour on Spilled Blood. These are all museum/cathedrals, but one may also visit Nikolsky Sobor, for example, to see the inside of a working Orthodox church. Also in Saint Petersburg, one may visit Alexander Nevsky Monastery and Cemetery. Located here are the graves of many famous Russian composers, writers, and artists. In Moscow, one should visit the very old churches of the Kremlin and certainly see the outside of the fairytale-like Saint Basil’s Cathedral.</p>
<p>With over four hundred museums in Saint Petersburg alone, there is bound to be a place of interest for everyone!Please, be very careful asking for recommendations of museums you choose to visit when you have limited time. It is very often that foreigners ask for recommendations from locals and get a lot of ideas of must sees. You should consider that places that are interesting for locals can be not so fabulous for foreigners who don’t know its culture and history as deeply. For example, when you ask a typical citizen of Saint Petersburg what you should visit, they will recommend the Hermitage (of course), Peter and Paul Fortress, Cruiser Aurora, and Kunstkamera. During fifteen years working with foreigners, I almost haven’t found anybody who was satisfied with Cruiser Aurora and Kunstkamera. For Russians, these places mean a lot (because they were the most interesting museums when they were children), but for people who visit Russia for the first time and have only three days, these places will be not so impressive as they might expect.</p>
<h2>Literature</h2>
<p>As of 2010, the literacy rate in Russia was 99.6 percent; this is among the highest around the world. When traveling around the cities by public transport, you will note that everyone is reading—on the metro, on the bus, and in marshutka taxis! In Saint Petersburg, you will find bookstores around every corner in the city center. There a lot of stores selling old books too. Literature is a very important part of Russian life.</p>
<p>Russia is blessed with a great literary history. Some well-known authors include: Alexander Pushkin, Leo Tolstoy, Dostoevsky, and Anton Chekov. In schools, children are required to read Tolstoy’s epic novel War and Peace and Dostoevsky’s Crime and Punishment. (You probably thought having to read Grapes of Wrath was bad!) Of course there are philosophers, playwrights, and poets too many to name, but while visiting Russia, you may walk the streets where they walked or their characters walked. You may visualize Raskolnikov kissing the ground of Sennaya Ploshad!</p>
<h2>Theater</h2>
<p>Russians also love live performances. You can find almost any venue for performance in Russia: opera houses, drama theaters, musical theaters, concert halls, jazz clubs as well as arenas where one can see pop music’s most famous stars.</p>
<p>There are some very interesting things about going to a live performance in Russia. First, you will notice the audience contains a great mix of people: from very old to very young, from very rich to rather poor, and everything in between. There is such a mix because Russians are proud of their artistic heritage, and the government also supports the arts as a treasure of the nation. Second, you may notice that if people like the performance, they don’t usually yell “Bravo” but instead clap in unison! Third, many of the concert venues are architectural relics as well. So you may have come to see a show, but you should certainly take a look around the beautiful building it is taking place in.</p>
<p>Between the Mariinsky and the Bolshoi, the two most famous opera houses in Russia, there is a great rivalry for which is the best in the country. Both theaters are of world renown, and if you enjoy opera or ballet, a visit to either is certainly a must.</p>
