<h1>Planning Your Trip—Moscow vs. Saint Petersburg</h1>
<p>Always plan your trip starting with Moscow and then move to Saint Petersburg. You will see the capital of the biggest country in the world, feel its crazy stressful rhythm, and then you can visit the very relaxed, friendly, calm, and warmhearted city – St. Petersburg.</p>
<p>Always choose Saint Petersburg for the final point of your trip; it will give you more options to organize an unforgettable farewell event—a gala dinner in one of the six hundred palaces, a private opera, a ballet performance, or a white night cruise on the canals and rivers of Saint Petersburg.</p>
<p>Plan your Moscow trip to be on a weekendDuring weekdays, all Moscow hotels are occupied by businessmen who are ready to pay any price for accommodation, but they usually leave on Friday. During Friday and Saturday nights, hotels are empty. That’s why it is possible to negotiate lower rates at one-third the price for the weekend.</p>
<p>In order to visit more during site inspection, plan it for weekends in both cities—better traffic will help you to see more.</p>
<p>Moscow is a destination for international conferences, congresses, and board meetings. Saint Petersburg is a real incentive destination due to diversity of venues, museums, and attractions.</p>
<p>Transportation (big buses or coaches) is very different in both cities. In Saint Petersburg, businessmen invest money in buses due to the large amount of tourists during the summer season. They start to make a return on their investment much faster than in Moscow. That’s why if you compare the level of buses in both cities, the Saint Petersburg ones are better in quality and can offer a bigger fleet of deluxe buses.</p>
<h1>Arriving to Russia—Your Visas and Passing Through Customs</h1>
<p>If your clients are participating in conferences or incentive trips, apply for a tourist visa .A business visa requires a completely different procedure and will require different papers, and it is a more complicated process.</p>
<p>You can ask for visa support documents in the hotels or in a Destination Management Company, but they need to be registered in the Official List of of tour operators that give them the right to provide visa support papers.</p>
<p>Destination Management Company will need information from you, at the latest, two weeks before arrival to the port. They will send you a tour ticket for each visitor. You will need to print it and show it to the customs officers together with your passport.</p>
<p>As meeting or travel planner you will need to provide your partner in Russia (DMC or incoming tour operator) with the following information: full passport name, passport number, validity of passport, date of birth, and citizenship.</p>
<p>If you want to impress your clients or if you have VIPs who don’t want to stay in queue, you can order a special service called fast track; then you will be met near the plane and go through customs counter without waiting in queue.</p>
<p>Remember that you can import up to USD 10,000 (or equivalent) into the country and export up to USD 3,000 from Russia without declaring it.</p>
<p>If you import over USD 10,000 or certain categories of goods like electronics items, jewelries, antiques, and valuable musical instruments, you must complete a customs declaration form.</p>
<h1>Traffic and Transportation</h1>
<p>Unfortunately in Russia, we don’t have a polite driving culture. All drivers go very fast; it is very difficult to find a driver who drives slowly and carefully. Usually Russian drivers don’t help people get in and out of the car because unfortunately, they think it is a sign of weakness (you must remember seventy years of soviet style hospitality). If you don’t ask the driver to dress in a suit, he will not dress that way automatically. Drivers often speak on the phone when driving (even if it is forbidden in Russia), and they can cut off other cars, not letting them go first. When you order transport for your group or individuals, use professional people, ask help of Destination Management Companies, who can give you transportation with drivers who don’t do it. Usually, DMCs have a checklist that they created together with their transportation partner, and the drivers follow them. DMCs will always recommend and book for you a professional driver who knows how to drive as it should be in civilized countries.</p>
<p>Always mention what dress code you would like to have for your drivers. Pay attention to it.</p>
<p>Water for drinking is not automatically put on the buses. Ask if you need it. Professional DMCs always put water for US groups, but for other countries, they always ask if they need it. Plus this water is not complimentary.</p>
<p>Air conditioners can be issues for American clients as in Russia we don’t use such low temperatures in transport. Always discuss the exact temperature you would like to have.</p>
<p>Parking near train stations, airports, and restaurants is forbidden. That’s why you always need a guide or escort to meet your group and call the driver to bring the vehicle to the spot. If you order just a car for airport pickup, the driver will not be able to leave his car near the entrance; he will park it far from the airport, and after he meets the guests, he will have to go get the car or the guest will have to go with suitcases to the parking spot. For this reason, it is better to order an escort or guide.</p>
<p>If there are a lot of arrivals in airports, always order two meet-and-greets for each terminal.</p>
<p>There are not many English-speaking drivers. Those who can speak English cost the same as having an English-speaking escort in the car. That’s why it is better to take a guide/escort to the bus.</p>
<p>Discussing transportation remember that in Saint Petersburg, the transportation fleet is much better than in Moscow. (See chapter 1.)</p>
<p>In Moscow, in order to save time in traffic from airport to the city center, you can use airport express (but it is recommend only for individuals).</p>
<p>Sometimes incentive clients insist on organizing Trans-Siberian trips andfind it very exciting. You as a planner must prepare them; prepare them that small towns in Russia are very different from what they used to have in Europe and what they expect from real incentive trips. Yes, you can rent the Orient Express train for them, but infrastructure in the towns on the way is not so developed as in Moscow and Saint Petersburg.</p>
<p>Usually, people depart from Moscow, taking stops in Ekaterinburg, Novosibirsk, Irkutsk, Baikal, and then continue to Mongolia and to China.</p>
<h1>Russian Guides</h1>
<p>Always ask about the experience of the guide—ask them about which companies they usually work with. If you have a VIP incentive group, never use guides who usually work with big cruise companies or tour operators. It will be very difficult to change the style of work of an experienced guide. That’s why choose from the very beginning a MICE guide.</p>
<p>Always discuss dress code as in Russia, people have different perceptions about business attire. If you don’t mention exactly how you would like guides to be dressed, they can come in tank tops, shorts, and slippers (it is not about MICE guides).</p>
<p>When bringing uniforms for guides for big incentives, try to find something universal that will fit different weathers during one day.</p>
<p>Always have a briefing with the guide giving them the background of your project, and give more details about the experience and expectations of your guests. Tell more about their interests—do they like art, what period, what school, etc. Especially recommended for Hermitage; the collection there is so huge that you can spend all day only in the rooms of Flemish artists or impressionists.</p>
<h1>Art</h1>
<h2>Miseums</h2>
<p>If you have only three full days in Saint Petersburg, always include Hermitage and Peterhof in summer period and always put them on different days. If you visit Hermitage, it is better to visit something different, like the Museum of Modern Art or the famous farmers’ market during the same day. Catherine Palace is very impressive, but it is quite similar to Winter Palace. Meanwhile, the fountains of Peterhof are really unique, and in combination with Hermitage, it is very interesting.</p>
<p>During winter season, it is better not to go to Peterhof (as fountains are closed for winter season) and visit the Amber Room of Catherine Palace.</p>
<p>Catherine Palace is located very close to the airport (twenty minutes), so it will be clever to plan it for the day of departure on the way to the airport.</p>
<p>Plan to visit only one grand palace a day. Don’t put Hermitage and Russian Museum, Peterhof and Catherine Palace on the same day. You will be too exhausted after one of them and will not enjoy the second palace.</p>
<p>Always plan for palaces in the morning, when people are fresh and not exhausted. For the afternoon, plan something more simple—cathedrals, canal tours, metro visits.</p>
<p>Remember that Hermitage and Kremlin are the most popular museums in Russia—that’s why they are always overcrowded. Entrance time for your group will always depend on confirmation from administration, so you must be ready that it can be different from the original time you wanted.</p>
<p>It is better to visit Hermitage before opening or after. It’s better to pay more but be alone in the palace and enjoy art. Always offer this option to your client – they will appreciate it.</p>
<p>Hermitage makes all groups more than five persons to have earphones and they are not complimentary, so plan them in the budget. If you have private eraly or late visit, you will not need earphones for group</p>
<p>You can have excursions inside of the museum only with licensed guides.</p>
<h2>Theater</h2>
<p>Individual tickets not more than two can be bought through the Internet on official sites. For groups, you need to book them through official agencies only.</p>
<p>You can rent basically any theater for your conference or events during the day and especially during the period of theater vacations.</p>
<p>Very popular program for tourists is a backstage visit of Mariinsky and Bolshoi theaters; when you meet with a member of the troupe, you see their preparation before a performance, storage, etc.</p>
<p>For dance lovers, you can go to some schools of ballet where children are studying dancing. You will see how they are training and meet with children of five to seven years old who will dance in Bolshoi or Mariinsky.</p>
<p>You can easily organize a private performance of an opera soloist or a private ballet performance during your event. Usually, we organize a ballet potpourri for twenty minutes that will include pieces of famous easily recognizable ballets. An opera performance during your dinner or conference must be no longer than twenty minutes.</p>
<h1>Money and Shopping</h1>
<p>Try to organize shopping time for your tourists into the program, but not on the last day as after people buy vodka or something, they put it in hand luggage and cannot go through airport control.</p>
<p>It is highly recommended to do shopping in certain souvenir shops like Beluga or Onegin in Saint Petersburg, where you can have unique choices and you are safe.</p>
<p>When visiting the Red Square, enter GUM to see the main department store. Go to Gastronom 1—it represents shops of the soviet period with exactly the same assortment as it was during the ’70s (but with combination of best delicatessens from around the world.)</p>
<p>Gostiny Dvor is a famous place in Saint Petersburg, but it is not as impressive as it is from outside—that’s why don’t waste your time for shopping there.</p>
<h1>Living Situation and Hotels in Russia</h1>
<p>It is strongly recommended to book hotels through local agents as they have better purchasing power since they work with these hotels more often and they can get better rates. After you send a direct request to a hotel and then to Destination Management Company, the hotel will not give better rates than they already gave to you. Meanwhile, if you had asked DMC to check rates first, it would be much better.</p>
<p>Planning trip remember about seasons (weekdays in Moscow; June in Saint Petersburg). It will help you to save a lot of money if you plan it right.</p>
<p>There are periods when the government reserves all rooms for economic forums, etc. Always check with Destination Management Company if it is reasonable or even possible to go at this period; maybe if you can change your dates by one week or a few days you will get much better rates.</p>
<p>Booking of room block is considered reserved only after getting 10 percent deposit on the basis of first come, first serve.</p>
<p>Usually all hotels offer rates that include buffet breakfast, but sometimes it can be not included, so pay your attention to that. Sometimes for individual visitors and groups, they are offering a different type of buffet menu, so double-check what is included on the menu in order to avoid miscommunication.</p>
<h1>Restaurants and Nightclubs</h1>
<h2>Restaurants</h2>
<p>If you want to eat in a normal (not fancy) place, ask how long the restaurant is opened. If it is older than one year, the chances that it is a really good place are higher.</p>
<p>When you ask for recommendations from regular people, they will recommend to you places that may not be interesting for you because they are new for Russia but for a foreigner is a usual place.</p>
<h2>Russian Etiquette and Specifics</h2>
<p>Even if a restaurant is extremely popular and really good for individuals, it doesn’t mean that it is good for a group. It can happen that they don’t have enough facilities for cooking the same dishes for a big group (they don’t have enough ovens or not enough of the same plates to serve dishes); sometimes waiters who are really good for individual service cannot work for big banquets. Always check if they have had positive experience working with big groups and if they can discuss an exact menu that they can cook for a large amount of people.</p>
<p>Always let the restaurant know (before the event) if you pay for wine and drinks upon consumption that you will count the empty bottles at the end of the event. Of course, it happens very seldom, but sometimes restaurants can try to cheat and say that you drank more than it actually was.</p>
<p>Before the event, check with the restaurant if the beer is in the fridge.</p>
<p>Always ask to serve bottled beer and discuss it, as draft beer will take too long to pour and serve for a big group.</p>
<p>Always discuss what sort of beer and ask to prepare a certain amount as restaurants may not have enough in stock.</p>
<p>If you don’t discuss the set up with the restaurant in advance, they will automatically put one long table (or U-shape) for everybody. Always check the exact setting you need.</p>
<p>During Russian banquets with family style starters, they put all drinks in the middle of the table so people are able to pour for themselves. Always discuss how you want wine to be served.</p>
<p>It is almost impossible to find kosher or halal foods in Russia; always discuss it in advance.</p>
<h2>Wine Culture</h2>
<p>Restaurants don’t have stocks of wine, even if it is a high-end wine restaurant. They can have a very long wine list, but they will have only a couple of bottles of each wine. It is strongly recommended to choose wine in advance and pay for it in order to guarantee there will be enough (to let the restaurant buy the required amount of wine).</p>
<p>If you don’t choose wine in advance for your group and chose on the spot, it can happen that they don’t have cheap wine, only the very expensive ones.</p>
<p>If you pay for wine upon consumption during event, ask the manager not to throw away empty bottles as restaurants have been known to fool customers.</p>
<p>You can confirm the exact wine no earlier than a month or two before the event as restaurants cannot guarantee you this wine due to suppliers.</p>
<p>During tasting and site inspections, when you try wine, always ask if it is possible to have such a wine for the whole group as it can be that they have this wine only in limited amounts.</p>
<p>Remember that if you ask the name of the wine, they will send you just a brand name and no year of production and region. In Russia, there is a lack of wine professionals.</p>
<h2>Nightclubs in Russia</h2>
<p>Going to a nightclub, be aware that a lot of club visitors are underage (in Russia it is sixteen years old).</p>
<p>When planning to go to a club, take cash with you as not all clubs accept credit cards.</p>
<p>There is a lot of smoke inside clubs, so for people who don’t smoke, it is not very comfortable.</p>
<p>In many city guides, you will find a lot of advertising for nightclubs, but they are oriented towards male foreigners (and they don’t mention it in ads), so check with locals to find out what type of club it is. This means they are more likely to be stripclubs or topless clubs.</p>
<h1>People</h1>
<h2>People and Religion in Russia</h2>
<p>When our groups have church tours, local guides rovided by Destination Management Company always tell the whole story outside of the church, and inside, the guest must see without comments of the guide because it is forbidden to have conversations in the church.</p>
<p>Inform your clients in advance that it is better not to take with you big bags and bottles of water when you go to the Cathedral of Christ the Savior as there is very strict security control and bag check. They don’t allow big bags and bottles with liquids to be brought inside.</p>
<h2>Russian People and Politics</h2>
<p>Don’t make and participate in any unauthorized political manifestation. In Russia, it is forbidden to have any meetings if you don’t have the government approval for it. Even if you personally don’t have trouble, the company who sent your visa support papers and guaranteed your program in Russia will have problems.</p>
<p>It is not recommended to criticize the Russian politic system in front of local people. You need to know that even if Russians don’t like the current political situation and they always complain about it, they will never accept any criticism and negative comments from anybody outside the country. It is a very strange form of patriotism and national pride, and it is very difficult to explain, but this is a fact—you just don’t need to try it.</p>
<p>A lot of people from older generations still miss the Soviet Union, thinking that life was better at that time. If you discuss this question with them, be very patient—you will hear a lot of stories of how life was better—and never criticize them.</p>
<h2>Telephone and E-mail Culture in Russia</h2>
<p>Dialing numbers from Russia—dial + (not 00) then country code without zeros, city code, and then number.</p>
<p>Ask your Destination Management Company or agent to prepare telephones with prepaid SIM cards for every member of your event team. You can rent it, but it is much easier to buy a new one. Using local SIM cards for your team during an event will save you a fortune as roaming in Russia is one of the most expensive in the world.</p>
<h2>Toilets in Russia</h2>
<p>In all restaurants offered by Destination Management Companies toilets are OK.</p>
<p>If you are organizing an event not in the classical venues, it is possible to bring mobile toilet cabins, and luckily in Moscow and Saint Petersburg, there are different options—from simple to very sophisticated. In other Russian cities, the maximum you can expect is a blue-colored plastic cabin.</p>
<p>When you have a special event in public museums, always check that toilets were additionally cleaned before the event and all supplies were brought additionally. Usually, what the museum has will not be good enough for your clients. Usually, we ask the catering company to provide towels, flowers, paper, soap, etc. You always need to discuss it in advance.</p>
<p>Also plan to have a person responsible for toilet maintenance during the event and usually venues (like museums) do not provide enough staff for it.</p>
<p>When you are planning programs for a group, plan it in such a way so they will have a chance to stop every few hours in places where they may go to the toilet.</p>
<h1>Holidays, Customs, and Traditions</h1>
<p>When planning a program for a group or event, take into consideration that on the ninth of May (Victory Day), twenty-seventh of May (Saint Petersburg City Day), and fifth of September (Moscow City Day) the whole city center is blocked by military parades or city celebrations and main streets are closed, so you your guest will not be able to drive on the main street during these days.</p>
<p>When planning events in December, remember that this is the month of corporate New Year’s parties and all venues are reserved starting from summer. So for December, make reservations of venues and prepayments as soon as you can; otherwise, it will be sold to Russian corporations.</p>
<p>The same with restaurants; make reservations there for December events as soon as you are ready to confirm locations.</p>
<p>The same situation with the twenty-fifth of May (Last Bell Day) and twentieth of June (Prom Day).</p>
<p>If you have a program in January, finalize all details before the twenty-fifth of December; otherwise, you will not be able to make fast corrections with suppliers due to the long holidays.</p>
